    "Rating outlook",
    """<p>Headquartered in Hedehusene, Denmark, DSV is the fifth-largest third-party logistics (3PL) company in the world and the third-largest air and sea freight forwarder. It is active in over 90 countries and employs 79,000 people. The company was formed in 1976 by 10 independent Danish haulers, and since then, it has grown organically, supported by more than a handful of transformational acquisitions. Its shares are listed on the Nasdaq Copenhagen Stock Exchange and has a market cap of around DKK291 billion (€39 billion). In 2021, the company reported revenue of DKK182.3 billion (€24.5 billion) and EBIT before special items of DKK16.2 billion (€2.2 billion). </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="5dd38308-8f75-11ec-ba16-693f3f207a39"/></td><td><Artifact id="ea9ab884-8f74-11ec-ba16-693f3f207a39"/></td></tr></table>""",

    "<p>The stable outlook reflects our expectation that DSV will continue to realise an operating margin of around 8-9% while maintaining Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA of around 1.8x over the next 12-18 months. We expect any sizable acquisitions to be financed with equity support and share buybacks to be balanced with the level of FCF generation.  </p>",
    "<p>We view DSV's liquidity as good. While the company usually has a relatively low cash balance, typically 1%-2% of revenue, sustained FCF generation is supporting the company's liquidity profile. As of the fourth quarter of 2021, the company's cash balance was DKK8.2 billion, with part of it restricted. Furthermore, the company had access to DKK8.1 billion of revolving credit facilities with no material adverse clauses (MAC) but with financial covenants. We understand the company's policy is to have liquid reserves (cash and undrawn facilities) of at least €150 million at any time. In terms of cash uses, working capital swings are fairly low with no particular seasonal patterns; the largest driver is changes in volumes. Because DSV runs an asset-light business, its reported capital spending has historically been low at DKK1.2 billion - DKK1.4 billion in the last three years. Together with contractual lease payments, we expect Moody's-adjusted capital spending to hover at around DKK5.0 billion over the next three years.  </p>",

    """<h2>Asset-light 3PL company with historically above industry-average profitability </h2><p>DSV is an asset-light global 3PL company with focus on freight forwarding services for air, ocean and road transport, as well as housing a medium-sized contract logistics business. It is not an asset owner nor does it lease transportation assets (other than trailers for its road division), instead the company focuses on facilitating transport and offering services such as cargo consolidation, warehousing, customs clearance, purchase order management and other products. As the company does not own fixed assets and instead leases terminals and warehouses, its business model is flexible in terms of adjusting its scale and capacity as needed. Although large scale does not in itself guarantee higher profitability, acquiring volume and expanding geographic reach have been integral factors in DSV's strategy to grow its business as well as gradually increase profitability. In the last 10 years, revenue and gross profit have almost tripled and the EBIT margin has expanded to almost 9% from 5% as seen in Exhibit 5. For the next 12-18 months, our projections for the Moody's-adjusted operating margin of 8%-9% is based on that part of the record high figure for 2021 was attributable by the exceptionally strong demand and tight supply induced by the pandemic. We therefor do not rule out a slight decline in profitability.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="f258c290-8f75-11ec-ba16-693f3f207a39"/></td></tr></table><p>A strength of DSV is its higher-than-peer profitability in all three divisions: Air and Sea, Road and Solutions (see Exhibit 6 for Air and Sea), partly explained by strategic decisions taken many years ago to streamline the company's IT architecture. It includes a centrally governed enterprise architecture as back-end and one single transport management system per division in the front-end, which supports the productivity of the processes and workforce. Another element of DSV's IT strategy is its scalability, which enables a swift integration of acquired companies and the potential to realise significant cost synergies quickly. </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="333350d8-92f9-11ec-a783-06501b6621eb"/></td></tr></table><h2>Highly competitive markets with sensitivity to freight volumes</h2><p>The freight forwarding and logistics industry is highly competitive and characterised by intense price competition, low margins and relatively low barriers to entry. Furthermore, DSV faces competition from other freight forwarders, integrated carriers, logistics companies and third-party logistics providers. For freight forwarding (Air and Sea), around 40% of global revenue is generated by the 10 largest companies. In contract logistics, the share of the 10 largest companies is even lower — around 20%. This type of competition has resulted in many companies generating lacklustre EBIT margins, typically low- to mid-single digits in percentage terms. Therefore, we consider DSV's historically stable margins a key credit strength supporting the assigned rating.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="44701a16-92f9-11ec-a783-06501b6621eb"/></td></tr></table><p>Another risk is that customer relationships, other than contract logistics, are not based on long-term contracts, with minimum volume commitments from customers. One way for companies like DSV to mitigate this risk is a minimisation of customer concentration; DSV's 10 largest customers represent slightly over 10% of revenue, and its 100 largest customers account for around one-third of revenue, a key driver for the assigned A3 rating. The company's churn rate is also relatively low for both its Air and Sea, and Road divisions. Another way to fend off competition is the ability to be integrated in customers' supply chains by offering a broad service palette. We understand that almost 70% of DSV's largest customers do business with more than one division; the more integrated DSV can become, the higher the switching cost is for its customers.  </p><p>Although freight rates are volatile, DSV's Air and Sea freight forwarding division normally takes limited freight rate risks, given its policy to agree on up to three-month rate commitments with its customers. Longer commitments are covered by back-to-back agreements with carriers. For its Road division, suppliers are local and regional haulers that are contracted on a spot basis. As the lion's share of gross profit is not extracted from basic freight brokerage but from add-on services, volumes are much more important than the absolute level of freight rates.  </p><h2>Track record of successful equity financed M&amp;A transactions and disciplined financial policy </h2><p>Over the last 15 years, DSV has carried out five rather transformational acquisitions, expanding the group's revenue by 30%-50%. The acquisition targets typically generated lower profitability than DSV and, therefore, offered a clear business case for significant improvement in productivity. Usually, improvement entails realising cost synergies by reducing headcount in, among others, IT, operations and finance, as well as costs of maintaining systems and infrastructure. We understand management has a target of completing integration and realising full run-rate synergies within two to three years of an acquisition.  </p><p>We note DSV's willingness to support the funding of acquisitions with equity. This willingness was most recently showcased by the acquisition of Agility in the second quarter of 2021, for which the purchase price of DKK29.5 billion was paid in DSV shares, corresponding to close of 10% of DSV's share capital.  </p><p>DSV's capital structure is governed by its financial policy of keeping net debt/EBITDA below 2.0x (excluding pension liabilities but including lease liabilities). The company has a clear order of prioritising cash flow: repayment of net interest bearing debt in periods when the financial gearing ratio is above the target range; value-adding investments in the form of acquisitions or development of the existing business; and distribution to shareholders by means of share buybacks and dividends.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="0a6be788-8f7e-11ec-ba16-693f3f207a39"/></td></tr></table><p>As Exhibit 7 shows, the company has always let its leverage target steer the level of shareholder remuneration to be paid out. Such was the case in 2016, when the company acquired UTI Worldwide Inc. in late 2015. The board then took the decision to cancel share buybacks, and thus, leverage decreased to 1.0x in 2017 from 2.0x in 2016. Notwithstanding the disciplined financial policy, there is always a risk of the timing of generous share buybacks coinciding with adverse market conditions or economic shocks. For 2022, the company has so far announced DKK3.7 billion in share buybacks. We have, however, included a total of DKK8.9 billion for 2022 and another DKK10 billion in 2023. </p>""",

In terms of cash uses, working capital swings are fairly low with no particular seasonal patterns; the largest driver is changes in volumes.

This profitability stems from a dedicated management team, productive workforce and a clearly defined and implemented IT strategy, which supports efficiency and further scalability of the business.

    """<h2>Asset-light 3PL company with historically above industry-average profitability </h2><p>DSV is an asset-light global 3PL company with focus on freight forwarding services for air, ocean and road transport, as well as housing a medium-sized contract logistics business. It is not an asset owner nor does it lease transportation assets (other than  trailers for its road division), instead the company focuses on facilitating transport and offering services such as cargo consolidation, warehousing, customs clearance, purchase order management and other products. As the company does not own fixed assets and instead leases terminals and warehouses, its business model is flexible in terms of adjusting its scale and capacity as needed. Although large scale does not in itself guarantee higher profitability, acquiring volume and expanding geographic reach have been integral factors in DSV's strategy to grow its business as well as gradually increase profitability. In the last 5 years, revenue and gross profit have  tripled and the EBIT margin has expanded to over 10% from 5% as seen in Exhibit 5. For the next 12-18 months, our projections for the Moody's-adjusted operating margin of 8%-9% is based on that part of the strong performance during the last two years was attributable by exceptionally strong demand and tight supply induced by the pandemic. We therefor do not rule out a slight decline in profitability.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="127557e0-b0fa-11ed-9bab-1671bbeae145"/></td></tr></table><p>DSV's main strengths are all visible through its higher-than-peer profitability in all three divisions: Air and Sea, Road and Solutions (see Exhibit 6 for Air and Sea), partly explained by strategic decisions taken many years ago to streamline the company's IT architecture. It includes a centrally governed enterprise architecture as back-end and one single transport management system per division in the front-end, which supports increased productivity of processes and workforce. Another element of DSV's IT strategy is its scalability, which enables a swift integration of acquired companies and the potential to realise significant cost synergies quickly. </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="77f70f58-b0f7-11ed-9bab-1671bbeae145"/></td></tr></table><h2>Highly competitive markets with sensitivity to freight volumes</h2><p>The freight forwarding and logistics industry is highly competitive and characterised by intense price competition, low margins and relatively low barriers to entry. Furthermore, DSV faces competition from other freight forwarders, integrated carriers, logistics companies and third-party logistics providers. For freight forwarding (Air and Sea), around 40% of global revenue is generated by the 10 largest companies. In contract logistics, the share of the 10 largest companies is even lower — around 20%. This type of competition has resulted in many companies generating lacklustre EBIT margins, typically low- to mid-single digits in percentage terms with a relatively higher degree of volatility. Therefore, we consider DSV's historically stable margins a key credit strength supporting the rating.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="2d4d2498-b100-11ed-9bab-1671bbeae145"/></td></tr></table><p>Another risk is that customer relationships, other than contract logistics, are not based on long-term contracts, with minimum volume commitments from customers. One way for companies like DSV to mitigate this risk is a minimisation of customer concentration; DSV's 10 largest customers represent slightly over 10% of revenue, and its 100 largest customers account for around one-third of revenue, a key driver for the A3 rating. The company's churn rate is also relatively low for both its Air &amp; Sea and Road divisions. Another way to fend off competition is the ability to be integrated in customers' supply chains by offering a broad service palette. We understand that almost 70% of DSV's largest customers do business with more than one division; the more integrated DSV can become, the higher the switching cost is for its customers.  </p><p>Although freight rates are volatile, DSV's Air and Sea freight forwarding division normally takes limited freight rate risks, given its policy to agree on up to three-month rate commitments with its customers. Longer commitments are covered by back-to-back agreements with carriers. For its Road division, suppliers are local and regional haulers that are contracted on a spot basis. As the lion share of gross profit is not extracted from basic freight brokerage but from add-on services, volumes are much more important than the absolute level of freight rates.  </p><h2>Track record of successful equity financed M&amp;A transactions and disciplined financial policy </h2><p>Over the last 15 years, DSV has carried out five rather transformational acquisitions, expanding the group's revenue by 30%-50%. Acquired companies typically generate lower profitability than DSV and, therefore, offers a clear business case for significant improvement in productivity. Usually, improvement entails realising cost synergies by reducing headcount in, among others, IT, operations and finance, as well as costs of maintaining systems and infrastructure. We understand management has a target of completing integration and realising full run-rate synergies within two to three years of an acquisition.  </p><p>We note DSV's willingness to fund acquisitions with equity. This was most recently showcased by the acquisition of Agility in the second quarter of 2021, for which the purchase price of DKK29.5 billion was paid in DSV shares, corresponding to close of 10% of DSV's share capital.  </p><p>DSV's capital structure is governed by its financial policy of keeping net debt/EBITDA below 2.0x (excluding pension liabilities but including lease liabilities). The company has a clear order of prioritising cash flow: repayment of net interest bearing debt in periods when the financial gearing ratio is above the target range; value-adding investments in the form of acquisitions or development of the existing business; and distribution to shareholders by means of share buybacks and dividends.  </p><table data-sbs="true"><tr><td><Artifact id="96ed5e52-b102-11ed-9bab-1671bbeae145"/></td></tr></table><p>As Exhibit 7 shows, the company has always let its leverage target steer the level of shareholder remuneration to be paid out. Such was the case in 2016, when the company acquired UTI Worldwide Inc. in late 2015. The board then took the decision to cancel share buybacks, and thus, leverage decreased to 1.0x in 2017 from 2.0x in 2016. Notwithstanding the disciplined financial policy, there is always a risk of the timing of generous share buybacks coinciding with adverse market conditions or economic shocks. For 2023, the company has so far announced DKK2.5 billion in share buybacks. We have, however, included a total of DKK11.3 billion for 2023 and another DKK11 billion in 2024. </p><h2>Competition from new entrants pose more medium term risks </h2><p>DSV and its peers in the 3PL market are facing competitors in companies that also are its customers -  Container shipping companies (carriers). The latter have long sourced around half of their revenue from freight forwarders but some are now trying to challenge this business model and instead sign contracts direct with shippers. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Container-Shipping-Europe-Cash-flush-carriers-embark-on-multibillion-dollar--PBC_1310278" title="www.moodys.com">carriers are aiming for a higher share of companies' logistics wallets </a>, as seen by increased M&amp;A activity over the last two years. Having said that, trying to challenge highly efficient companies like DSV will be very difficult and as such the strategy entails high execution risk. Over the next two to three years, however, we do believe that companies like <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/AP-Moller-Maersk-AS-credit-rating-821960289/summary" title="www.moodys.com">A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S </a> (Baa2 Positive) and <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/CMA-CGM-SA-credit-rating-806567358/summary" title="www.moodys.com">CMA CGM S.A. </a> (Ba2 Positive) will continue to shift its revenue mix to other transport and logistic activities similar to companies like DHL, owned by <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Deutsche-Post-AG-credit-rating-600054978/summary" title="www.moodys.com">Deutsche Post AG </a> (A2 Stable) - having a strong base in one transport mode but with other highly diversified logistics operations.  </p><p>So far, DSV as well as its closest competitor Kuehne+Nagel have both refrained from broadening offerings by acquiring hard assets such as airlines or container ships. This would also be contradictory to their operating model of being independent transport brokers (freight forwarders). Having said that, Kuehne+Nagel's main shareholder Klaus-Michael Kühne (53% of shares) built up a significant stake in <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Deutsche-Lufthansa-Aktiengesellschaft-credit-rating-277585/summary" title="www.moodys.com">Deutsche Lufthansa AG </a> (Ba2 Stable) during 2022 and is now the airlines' largest shareholder with 15% of the shares.

    """<h2>Upward trajectory of automotive margin is taking shape</h2><p>We expect Ford's automotive EBITA margin to increase to 4.6% in 2023, up from 4.2% in 2022 and only 1.2% in 2021. Volume growth, lower commodity pricing, and a decrease in costs from inefficiencies caused by supply chain issues underpin the margin improvement in 2023, as well as strong pricing on new product launches that mitigate industry pricing pressure that we expect to build as the year progresses. Specifically, Ford will introduce the new Super Duty in 2023 and a new 1 tonne Transit commercial van in Europe, which it believes will help to nearly double the earnings in the Ford Pro segment, along with additional growth in high margin software and services. </p><p>Tempering the margin improvement in 2023 are the increasing losses at Ford Model e, and our assumption that restructuring charges will exceed the nearly $1 billion of charges last year. The increasing losses at Ford Model e reflect the currently low production rate of electric vehicles, high battery costs, and elevated investment in the design and engineering of electric vehicles, as well as in software and architecture. </p><p>Nonetheless, Ford aims to achieve an 8% EBIT margin for its electric vehicle portfolio by the end of 2026, assuming an annual production capacity of 2 million vehicles. Scale, design and engineering, and lower battery cost are the main levers for Ford to realize its margin target. Strategically, Ford appears intent on a narrow offering of electric vehicles in order to maximize simplicity in its industrial operations. Ford's total company adjusted EBIT margin target is 10% by the end of 2026.  </p><p>Ford acknowledges that its current cost structure is not competitive due to complexity in its operations, ranging from product development and manufacturing, to supply chain management. Among others, the company is targeting $3 billion of structural cost reductions in Ford Blue, although specific initiatives have yet to be announced. </p><p>The discrepancy between our automotive EBITA margin and Ford's company adjusted EBIT margin narrowed, and is mainly attributable Ford Credit being excluded from our automotive EBITA margin. Other factors that contribute to the discrepancy are (i) our adjustment for pension expenses differs from Ford's, and (ii) only non-cash restructuring charges are added back.   </p><Artifact id="062ea478-ccbb-11ed-bead-4873136ca990"/><h2>Global Redesign helped to stem losses from overseas operations, but Europe and China continue to underperform</h2><p>Ford's operations in Europe and China have yet to achieve a sustainable adequate return, even though the restructuring efforts of Ford's Global Redesign program managed to stem the losses in these regions. In Europe, Ford's strength is its commercial vehicle business and management indicated it is evaluating its profile in the passenger vehicle market. Ford also announced it plans to eliminate 3,800 jobs over the next three years to create a more competitive cost structure. </p><p>In China, Ford has to contend with a very competitive market that includes a large number of domestic, electric-only, automakers. Ford considers its presence in China strategically important but sees the need to focus its operations while investing in the transition to electric vehicles. </p><p>Ford's overseas operations turned profitable in 2022, after generating losses of as much as $2 billion annually for several consecutive years and turning break-even in 2021. Restoring the profitability of Ford's operation outside of North America was a major focus of the company's Global Redesign plan, which was substantially completed in 2022. </p><Artifact id="ee5fbd02-cc9a-11ed-bead-4873136ca990"/><p>The plan's objective was to turn around the automotive operations, improve Ford's competitiveness and allocate resources to Ford's strongest businesses. In Europe, Ford implemented structural cost reductions by reducing 25% of its personnel in Western Europe and 26% of its manufacturing footprint, while heightening its focus on its competitive position in commercial vehicles (Ford Transit), including by growing Ford Pro. In South America, Ford shifted to an asset-light model with a product focus on pickups and commercial vehicles. The company exited its manufacturing operations in Brazil but continues the sale of imported vehicles. Ford's focus in China centered mainly on strengthening the Lincoln brand to improve its position in the premium segment of the market. </p><h2>Financial leverage moderating on earnings growth, debt repayment and pension deficit reduction</h2><p>We anticipate that leverage will remain moderate, ticking down to only 2.1 times at year-end 2023. The expected deleveraging in the next 12 to 18 months is driven by an increase in earnings, fueled by revenue growth and further margin expansion. Total debt remains unchanged in our forecasts. </p><Artifact id="fd724404-cc9a-11ed-bead-4873136ca990"/><p>Total adjusted debt at the end of 2022 was $27.3 billion. While similar to total adjusted debt at year-end 2019, reported debt is now nearly $5 billion higher and the amount of underfunded pension obligations is $4.2 billion lower.   </p><h2>Ford Credit provides important support for vehicle sales, presents potential drag on credit profile</h2><p><a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Ford-Motor-Credit-Company-LLC-credit-rating-300000/summary">Ford Credit </a>'s standalone baseline credit assessment is ba2. This assessment takes into consideration the company's well-managed portfolio asset quality, adequate capital cushion that protects its creditors against unexpected losses, and good liquidity. Ford Credit is the only rated auto captive firm that has a relatively limited lease portfolio, making it less vulnerable to a decline of used car prices than peers.

    """<h2>Upward trajectory of automotive margin is taking shape</h2><p>We expect Ford's automotive EBITA margin to increase to 4.7% in 2023, up from 4.2% in 2022 and only 1.2% in 2021. Volume growth, lower commodity pricing, and a decrease in costs from inefficiencies caused by supply chain issues underpin the margin improvement in 2023. Additional factors include strong pricing on new product launches that mitigate industry pricing pressure that we expect to build as the year progresses. Specifically, Ford introduced the new Super Duty in March 2023 and a new 1 tonne Transit commercial van in Europe. Ford believes these products will help to nearly double the earnings in the Ford Pro segment, along with additional growth in high margin software and services. </p><p>Tempering the margin improvement in 2023 are the increasing losses at Ford Model e, and our assumption that restructuring charges will exceed the nearly $1 billion of charges last year. The increasing losses at Ford Model e reflect the currently low production rate of electric vehicles, high battery costs, and elevated investment in the design and engineering of electric vehicles, as well as in software and architecture. </p><p>Nonetheless, Ford aims to achieve an 8% EBIT margin for its electric vehicle portfolio by the end of 2026, assuming an annual production capacity of 2 million vehicles. Scale, design and engineering, and lower battery cost are the main levers for Ford to realize its margin target. To achieve scale, Ford recently announced considerable price reductions to spur sales of the F-150 Lightning, the electric version of Ford's popular pick-up truck. Strategically, Ford appears intent on a narrow offering of electric vehicles in order to maximize simplicity in its industrial operations. Ford's total company adjusted EBIT margin target is 10% by the end of 2026. </p><p>Ford acknowledges that its current cost structure is not competitive due to complexity in its operations, ranging from product development and manufacturing, to supply chain management, in particular at Ford Blue. Ford aims to improve the profit margin at Ford Blue by maintaining a focused product offering, increasing the use of derivatives with substantial parts commonality to the base vehicle, reducing vehicle complexity, and improving vehicle quality. </p><p>The discrepancy between our automotive EBITA margin and Ford's company adjusted EBIT margin narrowed, and is mainly attributable Ford Credit being excluded from our automotive EBITA margin. Other factors that contribute to the discrepancy are (i) our adjustment for pension expenses differs from Ford's, and (ii) only non-cash restructuring charges are added back.   </p><Artifact id="101f5d32-15d2-11ee-beed-ac10fc9a3eaf"/><h2>Additional restructuring needed to turn around Europe and China</h2><p>Ford's operations in Europe and China have yet to achieve a sustainable adequate return, even though the restructuring efforts of Ford's Global Redesign program in the last few years managed to stem the losses in these regions. In Europe, Ford's strength is in the commercial vehicle business and management indicated it is evaluating its profile in the passenger vehicle market. Ford also announced plans to eliminate 3,800 jobs over the next three years to create a more competitive cost structure. </p><p>In China, Ford has to contend with a very competitive market that includes a large number of domestic, electric-only automakers. Ford considers it strategically important to maintain a presence in the Chinese passenger car market, but sees a need to focus its operations on the commercial vehicle segment. </p><p>Ford's overseas operations turned profitable in 2022, after generating losses of as much as $2 billion annually for several consecutive years and turning break-even in 2021. Restoring the profitability of Ford's operation outside of North America was a major focus of the company's Global Redesign plan, which was substantially completed in 2022. </p><Artifact id="1041e2bc-15d2-11ee-beed-ac10fc9a3eaf"/><p>The plan's objective was to turn around the automotive operations, improve Ford's competitiveness and allocate resources to Ford's strongest businesses. In Europe, Ford implemented structural cost reductions by reducing 25% of its personnel in Western Europe and 26% of its manufacturing footprint, while heightening its focus on its competitive position in commercial vehicles (Ford Transit), including by growing Ford Pro. In South America, Ford shifted to an asset-light model with a product focus on pickups and commercial vehicles. The company exited its manufacturing operations in Brazil but continues the sale of imported vehicles. Ford's focus in China centered mainly on strengthening the Lincoln brand to improve its position in the premium segment of the market. </p><h2>Earnings growth to moderate financial leverage further</h2><p>We anticipate that leverage will remain moderate, ticking down to only 2.1 times at year-end 2023 and likely below 2 times in 2024. The expected deleveraging in the next 12 to 18 months is driven by an increase in earnings, fueled by revenue growth and further margin expansion. Total debt remains unchanged in our forecasts. </p><Artifact id="1d666208-1b7f-11ee-9646-01df8e5ba0d0"/><p>Total adjusted debt at the end of March was $27.2 billion. While similar to total adjusted debt at year-end 2019, reported debt is now nearly $5 billion higher and the amount of underfunded pension obligations is $4.2 billion lower.   </p><h2>Ford Credit provides important support for vehicle sales, presents moderate drag on credit profile</h2><p><a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Ford-Motor-Credit-Company-LLC-credit-rating-300000/summary">Ford Credit </a>'s standalone baseline credit assessment is ba2. This assessment takes into consideration the company's well-managed portfolio, the quality of the assets, an adequate capital cushion that protects creditors against unexpected losses, and good liquidity. Ford Credit is the only rated auto captive finance subsidiary that has a relatively limited lease portfolio, making it less vulnerable to a decline of used car prices than peers. Leases represent less than 20% of total finance receivables and operating leases.  </p><p>In view of the ba2 standalone credit profile, Ford Credit presents a moderate drag on Ford's credit quality, consistent with our general view of captive finance subsidiaries. This assessment takes into account the important strategic ties and the formal support agreement between Ford and Ford Credit. Nonetheless, the present capitalization and liquidity of Ford are adequate to support Ford Credit, if needed. </p><p>Ford Credit has an 8.8% ratio of Tangible Common Equity to Total Managed Assets as of March 31, 2023. Liquidity is also good, although funding needs for the origination of finance receivables and leases are considerable. Ford Credit's extensive use of securitization also constrains access to alternative funding sources (secured debt represents about 40% of gross total assets). A weakening of Ford Credit's liquidity or a deterioration in its capital adequacy would increase the drag on Ford's credit quality. </p><p>We expect that Ford Credit's $124 billion of net receivables and operating leases will modestly increase in the next 12 months, as retail sales continue to grow. Earnings will be pressured relative to 2022, however, due to an increase in funding costs, unfavorable lease residual values, and the non-recurrence of derivative gains. </p>""",

    """<h2>Strong top line growth continues but inflation, promotions and cost pressures will impact earnings </h2><p>Walmart US comparable sales grew 6.5% in the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year with full year US comparable sales expected to grow around 4.0%. At Sam's club comparable store sales grew 9.5% in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Despite the healthy top line growth, higher inflation, a change in merchandise mix and cost pressures are expected to weigh on profitability for the current fiscal year with adjusted operating earnings expected to decline around 10%. Walmart has also experienced a tremendous increase in its online business, which is effectively pulling forward costs and likely creating increased stress to this channel and it is doubling down on delivery speed with increased same-day capability. The company has been able to leverage its stores to augment its growing online capability. Walmart's sales mix is still skewed toward consumables despite some movement toward a "normalized" after the disproportional non-discretionary focus during the pandemic. The primary factor driving the continued change in mix is the stressed consumer as inflationary pressure has caused disposable income to shrink, resulting in increased spending on lower margin essentials like food. This shift has caused margin compression. In addition, changing consumer preferences have resulted in excess inventories in certain product categories causing the company to increase promotions and cancel orders to adjust inventory categories to be more in line with demand thereby causing further margin pressure. Labor shortages, wage pressure and higher input costs are further exacerbating these pressures.  </p><p>Despite these challenges we expect the overall impact on Walmart's credit profile will be relatively benign as the company has built cushion over the last couple of years, and we expect the company to follow past practice of shifting financial strategies to largely maintain its credit profile. We also expect a significant retention of the strong revenue growth that occurred during 2020. Despite margin pressures, the company's credit metrics are still currently strong with debt/EBITDA of 1.8x, EBIT/interest at 9.3x times and retained cash flow/net debt at 46% at July 31, 2022. We expect Walmart's leverage to be at its normalized level of around 1.8 to 2.0 times in the next 12 months.  </p><h2>Online continues to leverage massive store network </h2><p>Walmart US' e-commerce sales grew 18% on a two year stack basis for Q2 of fiscal year ending January 2023 and global e-commerce sales for Walmart are expected to be over $75 billion for the fiscal year. However, Amazon remains the clear leader online, with a lead that we view as insurmountable. However, Walmart is widening the competitive gap between itself and all other brick-and-mortar retailers. This is taking on increasing importance as the surge in online sales, which we estimate has resulted in mid-20% penetration of US non-auto retail sales, is heightening the competitive landscape. <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Amazoncom-Inc-credit-rating-600042665"> </a>To continue to effectively manage the shift online, Walmart is necessarily deploying a significant portion of its capital spending on online, technology and logistics, with more limited spending on stores. The store spend also has an online focus, with some stores to expand backrooms to handle online orders on a ship from store basis. Given Walmart's existing ability to leverage its world-class distribution capability, and using its physical stores as a vehicle to control the last mile, we continue to believe there is potential for significant growth for the foreseeable future. With continuing increases in delivery speed, as well as store-pickup options, Walmart will significantly expand its base regardless of channel.  </p><p>We believe Walmart is one of the leaders in multi-channel retail as it continues to leverage its distribution, as well as leverage its technology and expertise. We also continue to believe that brick-and-mortar retailers maintain significant advantages when competing against pure-play online retailers, particularly because of the ability for consumers to receive goods on a same-day basis if they choose. The surge in curbside pickup experienced by Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc. has validated this premise. </p><h2>Investments will continue to create margin pressure, with market share benefits evident</h2><p>Walmart's continuing investments in price and increases in e-commerce spend over the past few years<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/JDcom-Inc-credit-rating-824625331"> </a> have borne fruit. Continued spending to expand its multi-channel capability, especially in grocery, which is a keydriver of foot and eyeball traffic, will continue to keep Walmart at the top of the "food chain" in grocery for the foreseeable future. Leveraging this additional traffic into higher-margin categories over time will drive improving margins in the US for both Walmart and Sam's Club, with International continuing to suffer from the losses at Flipkart, though we note that Flipkart's PhonePe payment app is approaching $300 billion in annualized payments. Walmart is continuing to double down on its grocery pickup and delivery capabilities, ratcheting up the pressure on all competitors in this key segment. </p><h2>Size and scale continue to provide many advantages</h2><p>As it closes in on $600 billion dollars in revenue, many operating and competitive advantages are readily apparent. Based on sheer size, if Walmart enters a product segment, it instantly becomes a formidable competitor by virtue of the enormity of even a small amount of per store square footage devoted to the product. It continues as the largest retailer in multiple segments such as food, apparel, dog food (its Ol' Roy continues as the top selling dog food brand in the world) and toys. Its position as one of the most important customers to virtually all of its key vendors provides a unique advantage, and this advantage is magnified when vendors experience shortages, as was evidenced during the height of the pandemic in 2020.  </p><p>Walmart continues to leverage its world-class supply chain and sourcing capability to present merchandise that provides a compelling value proposition to its targeted demographic throughout the world. Walmart continues to grow share in the all-important food category, indicating that store traffic remains solid and we believe this will bear fruit across other product segments. The Supercenter remains the most compelling format in US retail, and Sam's Club remains a strong competitor in the warehouse club segment.  </p><Artifact id="057a1412-4be3-11ed-870a-ddc766660b7a"/><h2>Rebalancing of international division to adapt to change</h2><p>As global retail evolves, Walmart has moved to adapt by modifying its footprint toward higher-growth markets such as India (acquisition of 81% of Flipkart in 2018), and China (joint-venture and ownership stake in JD.com), and away from slower-growth markets such as the UK, Brazil and Argentina. The Flipkart acquisition is the largest acquisition in Walmart's history and gives it immediate scale in that country's burgeoning e-commerce retail segment. Along with Walmart, other members of the ownership group include Tencent, Microsoft and Tiger International. Despite uncertainty from time-to-time with changes in Indian government policy regarding limits on foreign ownership and operation, demographics are compelling (population, millennials, smartphone growth, rising middle-class, etc.). While Flipkart will be dilutive as it is generating losses, the long-term potential evidenced by these demographics outweighs the negative short-term impact.  </p><p>Walmart's increasing presence in China via its relationship with JD.com uniquely positions the company in that growing market, and the aforementioned $1.2 billion logistics investment validates its long-term commitment to this key market. We continue to expect the growth from a square footage perspective to continue to tilt in the direction of International, with sales velocity likely to be faster as well (on a constant currency basis). At present, Canada and Mexico are bright spots and we continue to feel that Walmart is well positioned to reap significant benefits from its growing International footprint over time as it is redeploying its assets into more attractive markets. </p><h1>Liquidity analysis</h1><p>Walmart's liquidity profile is very strong with $13.9 billion in cash balances at July 31, 2022 and robust operating cash flow. Expenditures can also be significant for capital spending including continued enhancements to the supply chain, sourcing and online capability. The inventory buildup in the first half of this fiscal year has increased working capital usage but we expect this to normalize in the back half as inventory levels are reduced. We expect Walmart to maintain 100% backup at all times for funded commercial paper in the form of cash balances and committed bank credit facilities, with a significant portion ideally multiyear. Credit facilities are ample, with approximately $15 billion comprised of a 364 day facility maturing April 2023 and a 5 year credit facility maturing April 2027.  </p>""",

    """<h2>Inflation, merchandise mix, stressed consumer and cost pressures will impact growth and earnings </h2><p>Walmart had strong revenue growth in 2022 with Walmart US comparable sales growing 7% and Sam's club comparable store sales growing 14.6%. Walmart's sales mix is still skewed toward consumables despite some movement toward a "normalized" mix after the disproportional non-discretionary focus during the pandemic. The primary factor driving the continued change in mix is the stressed consumer as inflationary pressure has caused disposable income to shrink, resulting in increased spending on lower margin essentials like food. This shift has caused margin compression. In addition, changing consumer preferences resulted in excess inventories in certain product categories causing the company to increase promotions and cancel orders to adjust inventory categories to be more in line with demand thereby causing further margin pressure. Labor shortages, wage pressure and higher input costs are further exacerbating these pressures. All these factors resulted in a significant decline in operating income for the most recent fiscal year. Higher inflation, a change in merchandise mix, the uncertain macroeconomic conditions and cost pressures are expected to continue to weigh on the top-line and profitability for the current fiscal year with top-line growth expected to be around 2.5% to 3% and operating income growth of around 3.0% in fiscal year ending January 2024. Walmart has also experienced a tremendous increase in its online business, which is effectively pulling forward costs and likely creating increased stress to this channel but the company has been able to leverage its stores to augment its growing online capability. </p><p>Despite these challenges we expect the overall impact on Walmart's credit profile will be relatively benign as the company has built a cushion over the last couple of years, and we expect the company to follow past practice of shifting financial strategies to largely maintain its credit profile. We also expect a significant retention of the strong revenue growth that occurred during 2022. Despite margin pressures, the company's credit metrics are still currently strong with debt/EBITDA of 1.7x, EBIT/interest at 7.8x times and retained cash flow/net debt at 40.8% at January 31, 2023. We expect Walmart's leverage to be at its normalized level of around 1.7 to 2.0 times in the next 12 months.  </p><h2>Online continues to leverage massive store network </h2><p>Walmart US' e-commerce sales grew 17% for Q4 of fiscal year ending January 2023. Although Amazon remains the clear leader online, with a lead that we view as insurmountable, Walmart is widening the competitive gap between itself and all other brick-and-mortar retailers. This is taking on increasing importance as the surge in online sales, which we estimate has resulted in mid-20% penetration of US non-auto retail sales, is heightening the competitive landscape. <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Amazoncom-Inc-credit-rating-600042665"> </a>To continue to effectively manage the shift online, Walmart is necessarily deploying a significant portion of its capital spending on e-commerce, technology and logistics, with more limited spending on stores. The store spend also has an online focus, with some stores to expand backrooms to handle online orders on a ship from store basis. Given Walmart's existing ability to leverage its world-class distribution capability, and using its physical stores as a vehicle to control the last mile, we continue to believe there is potential for significant growth for the foreseeable future. With continuing increases in delivery speed, as well as store-pickup options, Walmart will significantly expand its base regardless of channel.  </p><p>We believe Walmart is one of the leaders in multichannel retail as it continues to leverage its distribution, as well as leverage its technology and expertise. We also continue to believe that brick-and-mortar retailers maintain significant advantages when competing against pure-play online retailers, particularly because of the ability for consumers to receive goods on a same-day basis if they choose. The surge in curbside pickup experienced by Walmart, Target, Best Buy, etc. has validated this premise. </p><h2>Investments will continue to create margin pressure but market share benefits evident</h2><p>Walmart's continuing investments in price and increases in e-commerce spend over the past few years<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/JDcom-Inc-credit-rating-824625331"> </a> have borne fruit. Continued spending to expand its multichannel capability, especially in grocery, which is a key driver of foot and eyeball traffic, will continue to keep Walmart at the top of the "food chain" in grocery for the foreseeable future. Leveraging this additional traffic into higher-margin categories over time will drive improving margins in the US for both Walmart and Sam's Club, with International continuing to suffer from the losses at Flipkart. However, Flipkart's PhonePe payment app is growing exponentially and based on the most recent round of funding is valued at about $12 billion. Walmart is continuing to double down on its grocery pickup and delivery capabilities, ratcheting up the pressure on all competitors in this key segment. </p><h2>Size and scale continue to provide many advantages</h2><p>With over $600 billion dollars in revenue, many operating and competitive advantages are readily apparent. Based on sheer size, if Walmart enters a product segment, it instantly becomes a formidable competitor by virtue of the enormity of even a small amount of per store square footage devoted to the product. It continues as the largest retailer in multiple segments such as food, apparel, dog food and toys. Its position as one of the most important customers to virtually all of its key vendors provides a unique advantage, and this advantage is magnified when vendors experience shortages, as was evidenced during the height of the pandemic in 2020.  </p><p>Walmart continues to leverage its world-class supply chain and sourcing capability to present merchandise that provides a compelling value proposition to its targeted demographic throughout the world. Walmart continues to grow share in the all-important food category, indicating that store traffic remains solid and we believe this will bear fruit across other product segments. The Supercenter remains the most compelling format in US retail, and Sam's Club remains a strong competitor in the warehouse club segment.  </p><Artifact id="9d728d08-d4af-11ed-aae1-3e81bd9d6b96"/><h2>Rebalancing of international division to adapt to change</h2><p>As global retail evolves, Walmart has moved to adapt by modifying its footprint toward higher-growth markets such as India (acquisition of 81% of Flipkart in 2018), and China (joint-venture and ownership stake in JD.com), and away from slower-growth markets such as the UK, Brazil and Argentina. The Flipkart acquisition is the largest acquisition in Walmart's history and gives it immediate scale in that country's burgeoning e-commerce retail segment. Along with Walmart, other members of the ownership group include Tencent, Microsoft and Tiger International. Despite uncertainty from time-to-time with changes in Indian government policy regarding limits on foreign ownership and operation, demographics are compelling (population, millennials, smartphone growth, rising middle-class, etc.). While Flipkart will be dilutive as it is generating losses, the long-term potential evidenced by these demographics outweighs the negative short-term impact.  </p><p>Walmart's increasing presence in China via its relationship with JD.com uniquely positions the company in that growing market. We continue to expect the growth from a square footage perspective to continue to tilt in the direction of International, with sales velocity likely to be faster as well (on a constant currency basis). At present, Canada and Mexico are bright spots and we continue to feel that Walmart is well positioned to reap significant benefits from its growing International footprint over time as it is redeploying its assets into more attractive markets. </p>""",

    "<h2>Tesla to maintain its lead in battery electric vehicle segment after ramp up of production capacity</h2><p>Tesla will maintain its leading position in battery electric vehicles, after it swiftly expanded its manufacturing footprint in the US, China and Europe. We estimate that Tesla will deliver nearly 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, a 34% increase compared to the 1.3 million vehicles that it delivered in 2022, and nearly double the deliveries in 2021. Considerable investments in new production facilities in Berlin and Austin enable the steep increase in vehicle deliveries, along with an expansion of the production capacity in Shanghai, and higher utilization of the manufacturing facility in Fremont. Tesla's aggregate annual production capacity is currently more than 1.9 million vehicles. </p><p>We anticipate that Tesla will maintain an aggressive plan to expand capacity and grow deliveries, in order to maintain its lead in the market. In addition to the swift increase in vehicle manufacturing capabilities, Tesla is also ramping up the production of battery cells for its most advanced battery, named '4680' after the dimensions of its cylindrical shape. </p><p>At the same time, other automakers are accelerating their transition to electric vehicles. The rapid increase in battery electric vehicles that are launched in the next two years could pose a threat to Tesla's growth prospects. However, we believe that the availability of these models remains limited in the next 12 months, at least outside China. Production volumes are constrained partially due to available battery capacity. Tesla has likely secured the largest battery cell capacity at this time because it started planning for a steep production increase at a much earlier stage. </p><p>To date, Tesla is dependent on primarily two models, the Model 3 and the Model Y. Furthermore, the Model 3 has yet to see a material refresh since its introduction in 2017. Tesla's vehicle line-up is expanding, however. Tesla's Class 8 semi-truck is in early production and the company delivered the first semi-truck in December. In addition, Tesla expects to enter early production for the new Cybertruck later in 2023. </p><h2>Profit margin set to compress, but to remain at industry-leading level</h2><p>We project Tesla's EBITA margin to decrease to 15.8% in 2023, down from our estimate of 18.9% for 2022. The expected decrease in margin reflects the considerable price reductions that Tesla initiated for several models in China, the US, and Europe. We believe that the price reductions in China were prompted by the expiration of tax credits for New Electric Vehicles, an increasingly competitive offering from other automakers, and slower economic growth prospects in China. More broadly, Tesla sees the price reductions as a means to make its vehicles more affordable to a larger group of consumers, in particular against the backdrop of slowing economic growth. In addition, we think that some of the price reductions in the US help Tesla to set its manufacturer suggested retail price below the maximum price for vehicles that qualify for the clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. Our assumptions resulted in a decrease in the average selling price per vehicle of about 10%. </p><p>Other factors that will weigh on margins in 2023 - albeit more modestly - are the tooling and production start of the Cybertruck, as well as the gradual production ramp of the Tesla Semi. </p><p>The impact of the assumed price reductions on the (automotive) gross margin will be partially mitigated by the operational leverage ensuing from the continuing steep increase in vehicle production. In addition, Tesla remains intensely focused on enhancing the efficiencies of its manufacturing process, for both vehicles and battery cells. The use of front and rear body castings in conjunction with a structural battery pack, for example, increases manufacturing efficiencies, because it eliminates a large number of separate components that otherwise would have to be assembled. A decrease in certain commodity costs, along with lower logistics costs, will also help mitigate the pressure on the (automotive) gross margin. </p><p>In view of its investments in domestic battery cell manufacturing capacity, Tesla will also benefit from the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for the production of battery cells. On a preliminary basis, Tesla estimated these benefits to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in 2023. </p><p>Despite our expectation for margin compression, we project EBITA in 2023 to be in line with 2022, because of the increase in vehicle deliveries that we expect. </p><p>Tesla's EBITA margin widened notably in 2021 and 2022. We attribute the margin increase to the company's increasing scale, the production ramp-up at its lower cost Shanghai Gigafactory and a shift in product mix with an increasing proportion of the Model Y. Price increases in certain regions and a return to positive margin for the Model S also helped increase the profitability. </p><h2>Outstanding debt limited to modest amount of non-recourse debt</h2><p>We expect Tesla to continue to operate with low financial leverage, after the company repaid more than $8 billion of debt in the last two years. With ample cash and very considerable free cash flow, Tesla does not have any external funding needs, despite a marked step-up in investments since 2021. </p><p>Tesla's non-recourse debt could increase if the company were to utilize the ABS market for product specific financing. Non-recourse debt was $2.0 billion as of December 31, about 80% of which were automotive asset-backed notes. </p><p>Debt/EBITDA dropped to only 0.3 times at year-end 2022, in our estimates.  </p>"

Tesla's Class 8 semi-truck is in early production and the company delivered the first semi-truck in December. Tesla expects to enter early production for the new Cybertruck later in 2023. </p><p>Importantly, the development of a next generation vehicle at a targeted 50% reduction in cost holds the prospect for a meaningful decrease in the reliance on the earnings contribution of the Model 3 and Model Y. </p><h2>Profit margin set to compress, but to remain at industry-leading level</h2><p>We project Tesla's EBITA margin to decrease to 15.8% in 2023, down from 18.9% in 2022. The expected decrease in margin reflects the considerable price reductions that Tesla initiated for several models in China, the US, and Europe. We believe that the price reductions in China were prompted by the expiration of tax credits for New Electric Vehicles, an increasingly competitive offering from other automakers, and slower economic growth prospects in China. More broadly, Tesla sees the price reductions as a means to make its vehicles more affordable to a larger group of consumers, in particular against the backdrop of slowing economic growth. In addition, we think that some of the price reductions in the US help Tesla to set its manufacturer suggested retail price below the maximum price for vehicles that qualify for the clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. Our assumptions resulted in a decrease in the average selling price per vehicle of about 8%. </p><p>Other factors that will weigh on margins in 2023 - albeit more modestly - are the tooling and production start of the Cybertruck, as well as the gradual production ramp of the Tesla Semi. </p><p>The impact of the assumed price reductions on the (automotive) gross margin will be partially mitigated by the operational leverage ensuing from the continuing steep increase in vehicle production. In addition, Tesla remains intensely focused on enhancing the efficiencies of its manufacturing process, for both vehicles and battery cells. The use of front and rear body castings in conjunction with a structural battery pack, for example, increases manufacturing efficiencies, because it eliminates a large number of separate components that otherwise would have to be assembled. A decrease in certain commodity costs, along with lower logistics costs, will also help mitigate the pressure on the (automotive) gross margin. </p><p>In view of its investments in domestic battery cell manufacturing capacity, Tesla will also benefit from the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for the production of battery cells. On a preliminary basis, Tesla estimated these benefits to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in 2023. </p><p>Despite our expectation for margin compression, we project EBITA in 2023 to be in line with 2022, because of the increase in vehicle deliveries that we expect. </p><p>Tesla's EBITA margin widened notably in 2021 and 2022. We attribute the margin increase to the company's increasing scale, the production ramp-up at its lower cost Shanghai Gigafactory and a shift in product mix with an increasing proportion of the Model Y. Price increases in certain regions and a return to positive margin for the Model S also helped increase the profitability. </p><h2>Outstanding debt limited to modest amount of non-recourse debt</h2><p>We expect Tesla to continue to operate with low financial leverage, after the company repaid more than $10 billion of debt in the last three years. With ample cash, short-term investments, and very considerable free cash flow, Tesla does not have any external funding needs, despite a marked step-up in capital expenditures since 2021. Debt/EBITDA dropped to only 0.3 times at year-end 2022. </p><p>Tesla's non-recourse debt could increase if the company were to utilize the ABS market for product specific financing. Non-recourse debt was $2.0 billion as of December 31, about 80% of which were automotive asset-backed notes. </p>",

While Altice UK has so far communicated that it does not intend to make a full bid to acquire the British telecom operator, we consider that there is a risk that this position could evolve over time leading to potential changes in the strategy and financial policy of the group.

However, we believe that the UK will partly reduce this gap over the next five years. We believe that BT is well positioned to benefit from increasing convergence thanks to its ownership of fixed and mobile networks. In April 2022, BT announced that it is to make EE its primary consumer brand moving forward, believing the move will make it easier to communicate its products to customers and simplify its internal processes. The company has operated the two separate brands ever since the £12.5 billion acquisition of the mobile operator in 2016. EE will now be the flagship for mobile and converged network services, as well as devices, while BT will remain in place for standalone broadband customers, television, and business customers. </p><p>However, we believe that BT will face increasing competition. In June 2021, Liberty Global and Telefonica closed the merger of their UK operations — cable operator Virgin Media and mobile network operator O2, respectively — in a 50-50 joint venture. Virgin Media and O2 have thus created a fully converged fixed-line and mobile communications operator in the UK that will compete with BT. We foresee that BT and Virgin Media/O2 will compete more aggressively in cross-selling fixed and mobile services, supporting increased convergence. Telecom operators typically offer lower prices to consumers for bundled services than the sum of individual fixed and mobile contracts. But such price concessions are more than offset by the increase in the number of services sold and reduced churn. The creation of a second integrated player will also increase the competitive pressure for mobile-centric operators in the UK, namely Vodafone UK<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Vodafone-Group-Plc-credit-rating-600018164/summary"> </a> and Three UK. Indeed, we think Vodafone UK and Three UK are likely to become more aggressive on pricing to defend their market shares because the large integrated companies will increasingly promote convergent offerings.  </p><h2>BT's joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery is positive from a business perspective</h2><p>On 12 May, BT announced its agreement to create a 50:50 joint venture with Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. to bring together their premium sport content, BT Sport and Eurosport UK, respectively, in Britain and Ireland. BT and Warner Bros. Discovery will enter into distribution agreements with the JV under which they will distribute the combined sports content to new and existing customers on their respective platforms. The transaction is expected to be completed by the end of 2022 and will be equity accounted by BT.  </p><p>As part of the transaction, BT will receive £93 million of installments over the three years following the transaction completion from Warner Bros. Discovery and up to approximately £540 million by way of an earn-out from the JV. However, we expect this agreement to have limited impact on the company's metrics. In accordance with this transaction, BT Sport will transfer £500-£600 million of wholesale revenues to the JV in additions to providing a £500 million revenue guarantee per annum to the JV to receive the package of content to distribute to BT Sport Retail customers.  </p><p>From a business perspective the JV agreement is positive for BT, as (1) it offers BT Sport customers access to additional content, (2) provides BT with an exit route and (3) enables BT to monetize its BT Sport asset which was making operating losses. BT customers who have access to BT Sport will additionally be granted access to Discovery's sport and entertainment content, including the discovery+ app. In addition, Warner Bros. Discovery will have the right to exercise a call option to acquire the entire shareholding of BT at a price to be determined at the time of exercise. Alternatively, if the call option is not exercised, BT will have the option to exit the JV through a sale or initial public offering (IPO). Furthermore, BT Sport which made an operating loss of 222 million in FY2022, had been launched in 2013, mainly as a means of attracting broadband customers that it has been losing to Sky. However, eventually BT decided to sell its sports content as a standalone product resulting in an increasing decorrelation between BT Sports subscribers and broadband subscribers. Therefore, this JV with Warner Bros. Discovery enables BT to partly monetize this asset with small profit margins while focusing its attention on rolling out its full fibre infrastructure.  </p><p>Additionally, the company also announced that the JV will enter into a new agreement with Sky extending beyond 2030 to provide for its distribution of the JV's combined sports content. </p><h2>Return to a modest revenue growth projected in FY 2023 supported by price increases in Consumer and fibre take-up at Openreach</h2><p>The negative impact from COVID-19 and to a lesser extent the underlying pressure on the Consumer, Enterprise, and Global segments (Enterprise and Global together referred as B2B) resulted in a revenue decline for BT of 6% in FY 2021 compared to the same period last year - in line with the guidance shared by BT following the coronavirus outbreak. The Consumer, Enterprise, and Global segments decreased by 5%, 8%, and 14% (excluding divestments and FX revenue was down 9%), respectively, compared to prior year. The decline across these segments was only partly mitigated by the 3% revenue growth at Openreach. In FY 2022, BT's revenue further decreased by 2% to £20.9 billion reflecting revenue decline in Enterprise (-5%) and Global (-10%) offset by growth in Openreach (4%), with Consumer flat for the year and returning to growth in the last quarter of the fiscal year. While the weakness in the B2B segment reflects the ongoing lower levels of business travel and roaming revenues, it also hints at structural challenges, including pressures on demand for traditional voice products which are replaced by low-margin IP-integrated services packages. New challenges were thrown up by the COVID-19 outbreak including a lower level of project/upgrade work by corporates which are still assessing their needs for office vs work from home balance as well as some likely preliminary impacts from cost rationalization in the face of higher inflation.  </p><p>BT operates in a highly competitive broadband market competing with the likes of VMED O2, Sky<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Virgin-Media-Inc-credit-rating-600017026"> </a>, alternative operators (although their share is still not material) and, to a lesser extent, from Vodafone and TalkTalk. The large number of competitors and the mature nature of the market has put pressure on average revenue per user (ARPU). For example, VMED O2 offers speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second (Gbps) across all of its network following the upgrade of its mostly hybrid co-axial infrastructre to DOCSIS 3.1 and the company intends to upgrade its cable network to FTTP by the end of 2028 to try to maintain competitiveness against BT. Vodafone and TalkTalk have also renewed efforts to establish themselves in the broadband market. We believe that competition is similarly intense in mobile. All major UK operators have now launched unlimited data offers and all of them are now providing 5G services. Vodafone and Three UK have been particularly aggressive in terms of pricing as 5G is marketed at no extra cost.  </p><p>Despite these challenges we expect BT to return to a modest revenue growth in FY 2023 after a sustained period of decline. Indeed, we expect BT to benefit from the positive impact of price indexation mainly in its Consumer segment and continued growth at Openreach whereby the loss of lower ARPU copper customers is more than offset by higher yielding FTTP clients. Openreach's 7.2 million premises passed with full fibre benefits from a strong take-up rate of 25%. The company currently has index-linked pricing across around two-thirds of its revenue before eliminations, primarily in Consumer and Openreach. From September 2020, BT introduced a pricing policy to create consistency across all its consumer and some SME products and services consisting of a single annual price rise of consumer price index (CPI)+3.9% for new and upgrading customers. In the context of a high inflation in the UK, this policy has led BT to implement price increases of above 9% in March 2022. However, we consider that these price increases may have a relatively limited impact on churn in the short-term as key competitors have implemented similar large price increases <mark>i</mark>n a more constructive competitive environment. The Consumer and Openreach segments should more than mitigate the continued weakness in Enterprise and Global segments for which there is a lack of visibility on timing for a potential stabilization. </p><Artifact id="cae42f98-f17b-11ec-8f34-541f8015d063"/><h2><em> </em>More positive revenue trend and the continued delivery of cost savings will drive EBITDA growth in FY 2023</h2><p>In FY 2021, adjusted EBITDA (as reported by the company) declined by 6% compared to prior year - in line with the guidance provided by the company following the coronavirus outbreak. All Consumer, Enterprise, and Global segments experienced sharp adjusted EBITDA drops of 12%, 12%, and 6% (excluding divestments, one offs and FX, the Global segment's adjusted EBITDA was up 3% in FY), respectively, and were only partly mitigated by strong adjusted EBITDA growth at Openreach. Openreach's adjusted EBITDA increased by 3% to £2,937 million in FY 2021 relative to the prior year, driven by higher rental bases in fibre-enabled products and Ethernet, despite these being partially offset by a decline in legacy copper products and higher operating costs, with increased service costs and FTTP provisions, pay inflation, and a special frontline bonus. However, we consider that following a trough reached in FY 2021, BT's adjusted EBITDA has now entered into a period of recovery. Indeed, adjusted EBITDA was up 2% to £7.6 billion in FY 2022 with the revenue decline more than offset by lower costs from BT's modernization programmes, tight cost management, and lower indirect commissions.  </p><p>We project further recovery in adjusted EBITDA towards £7.9 billion in FY 2023 - close to its EBITDA level of FY 2020 prior to the coronavirus outbreak - supported by the more favourable revenue trend and the realization of cost savings as part of the modernization programme. Our forecasts are moderately more conservative compared to management's guidance which confirmed its target to improve adjusted EBITDA to at least £7.9 billion by FY 2023 with sustained growth from that level going forward. </p><p>The company recently extended its cost savings target of £2 billion by end of FY 2024 to £2.5 billion by the end of FY 2025 within the previously communicated cost to achieve of £1.3 billion. The company already achieved gross annualized cost savings totaling £1.5 billion over FY 2021 and FY 2022. The transformation programme will continue to focus on simplifying the product portfolio, simplifying and automating the customer journeys, moving to a modern, modular IT architecture, and migrating customers from the legacy networks to FTTP and 5G networks. </p><h2>Significant capex spend over the next four years due to ambitious fibre rollout plan mitigated by expected positive impact on BT's business profile</h2><p>BT announced on 13 May 2021 its intention to significantly accelerate its FTTP target to 25 million homes by the end of 2026 from the initial 20 million target by the mid-to late 2020s. By March 2022, it had already passed 7.2 million FTTP premises. With the acceleration of the fibre rollout, BT also announced that it expects lower average build costs of £250 to £350 per premises passed down from its previous estimate of £300 to £400. </p><p>BT aims to cover most of the UK with its latest technology, including a significant rollout in rural areas. To reach its target of 25 million premises by the end of 2026, BT increased its build rate to a record 750,000 premises passed in the last quarter of FY 2022 at an average rate of over 58,000 premises per week. We note however that such an ambitious rollout plan is subject to execution and cost overrun risk. Importantly, BT experiences a strong take-up of its fibre services from its own customer facing divisions as well as third-party communications providers - over the last 12 months, BT increased FTTP connections (own and third-party) to 1.8 million as of the end of March 2022 from 0.9 million a year earlier. </p><p>We positively note that an increase in fibre capital spending will improve broadband quality, partly alleviate competition from alternative network providers (altnets) and support revenue growth thanks to the potential higher ARPU from fibre services. Additionally, this increased fibre target will be supported by the government's cash tax super deduction over FY 2022 and FY 2023, additional liquidity arising from the favourable outcome of the 5G spectrum auction in 2021 as well as increased clarity for future return on fibre investment from the conclusion of the Wholesale Fixed Telecoms Market Review (WFTMR) by Ofcom. However, it will also add pressure on cash flow as capital expenditures increased to £4.8 billion in FY 2022 from £4.2 billion a year earlier and will remain at an elevated level for the next four years. The annual £4.8 billion capex envelope includes £200 million of savings per annum from the recently announced lower build cost. </p><p>BT secured 5G spectrum in March 2021 at a competitive cost of £475 million (after assignment stage) which was significantly lower than our projections of £1.0 billion to £1.2 billion - our estimates were derived from average spectrum costs from recent auctions across Europe.  </p><p>Unlike Openreach and most alternative network providers, VMED O2 has not so far provided competitors with access to its network. In 2021, VMED O2 announced that it was considering wholesale arrangements to drive revenue and network utilization. While opening its network to third-party internet service providers (ISPs) could generate more revenue for the cable operator, this would further intensify network competition, challenging Openreach and altnets.  </p><h2>Strong decrease in BT's leverage in FY 2022 driven by a reduction in the pension deficit which may be volatile </h2><p>Following a spike at 3.7x on a gross basis or 3.4x excluding pre-funding for debt maturities, pension contributions and collateral in FY 2021, BT's leverage decreased to 3.0x in FY 2022. This significant year-on-year improvement was mainly driven by a reduction in the company's IAS19 pension deficit to £1.1 billion as of the end of FY 2022 from £5.1 billion in FY 2021. The improvement was also driven by the growing EBITDA to a lesser extent. Although we recognize that the pension deficit will remain subject to volatility, the improving operating performance in FY 2023 as well as large pension deficit contributions should contribute to containing Moody's adjusted leverage within the 3.5x downwards trigger set for BT's Baa2 rating. Such volatility could arise in the short-term term from a decrease in growth assets among others. </p><p>We note that projected leverage ratios include the negative impact of around 0.1x-0.2x from the introduction of the new lease accounting compared with our previous operating lease adjustment which has been looked through by Moody's. We note that leverage could also benefit from increasing use of hybrid notes issuance to refinance or raise existing/new debt. The $1,000 million hybrid securities due 2081 issued in November 2021 and the inaugural €500 million hybrid securities due 2080 issued in November 2020 are deeply subordinated obligations ranking senior only to common shares, pari passu with preference shares, and junior to all senior and subordinated debt and thus qualify for "basket C", i.e. 50% equity treatment, for the purpose of calculating Moody's credit ratios (please refer to Moody's cross-sector rating methodology 'Hybrid Equity Credit' dated September 2018). </p><Artifact id="0c2c2baa-f315-11ec-8f34-541f8015d063"/><p>Moody's gross leverage includes contributions payable to the BT Pension Scheme and cash collateral received from financial counterparties against certain in-the-money derivative positions reflected in the cash balance as of the end of March 2022. There were no pre-funding of short-term maturities as of the end of FY 2022. Pro forma for the use of these pre-fundings and cash collateral, Moody's adjusted leverage ratio was lower at 2.5x as 31 March 2022 (compared to 3.0x on a gross basis).  </p><p>Although the expanded and accelerated FTTP target will constrain cash flow generation over the next five years as capital expenditures will be maintained at around £4.8 billion, we project free cash flow (FCF) to remain weak. While BT has reinstated dividend payments from FY 2022 although at half the previous level and increase its capex spend, we project that these outflows will be mitigated by savings from the government's cash tax super deduction and growth in EBITDA in FY 2023. A FCF projected at around a neutral level will limit the amount of additional debt to be raised by the company.  </p><h2>Pension deficit may drag credit metrics</h2><p>On 13 May 2021, BT announced that it had reached an agreement with the trustee of the BT Pension Scheme on the 2020 triennial funding valuation and deficit repair plan. We consider that the agreement is marginally credit positive as it alleviates concerns about a potential step up in cash payments over the next three years compared to those agreed for the same period during the previous valuation as of 30 June 2017. Indeed cash payments scheduled over the period from FY 2022 to FY 2024 will be only slightly higher than those scheduled under the previous 2017 triennial funding valuation and reflect the reduction in the funding deficit to £7.98 billion as of 30 June 2020, broadly in line with the projected position from 30 June 2017, when the deficit was £11.3 billion. </p><p>The funding deficit decreased to £8.0 billion as of 30 June 2020. The Scheme actuary has carried out an interim assessment as at 30 June 2021, estimating the BT's pension scheme funding position had improved to a funding deficit of £4.1 billion as of 30 June 2021. BT and the Pension Trustee will agree cash contributions in the usual way at the next full triennial funding valuation, scheduled to take place as at 30 June 2023. For the purpose of calculating Moody's adjusted leverage for BT, we use instead the IAS 19 pension deficit which decreased to £1.1 billion as of 31 March 2022 from £5.1 billion one year earlier. </p><p>BT has closed the BT Pension Scheme for the future accrual of benefits for over 99% of the BT Pension Scheme active membership, which reduces BT's defined benefit pension liabilities buildup in the future.  </p><Artifact id="e0534c9e-f1b0-11ec-8f34-541f8015d063"/>""",

    """<h2>Large scale and strong position in the UK telecom market</h2><p>BT benefits from its position as the largest integrated communications service provider in the UK. As Exhibit 4 shows, in broadband, BT has an estimated 33% share of the UK market, followed by Sky Limited (part of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Comcast-Corporation-credit-rating-600067485/summary">Comcast Corporation </a> [A3 stable], 23%); <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/VMED-O2-UK-Holdings-Limited-credit-rating-868059631/summary">VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited </a> (VMED O2 [Ba3 stable], the 50:50 joint venture between <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Liberty-Global-plc-credit-rating-823474225/summary">Liberty Global Plc </a> [Ba3 stable] and <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Telefonica-SA-credit-rating-734508/summary">Telefonica S.A. </a> [Baa3 stable]; 20%); and TalkTalk Telecom Group Limited (TalkTalk, 9%). BT remains the leader in the UK broadband market. Nevertheless, its market share decreased over the past five years because of strong competition.  </p><p>Because of its brand EE, BT is also one of the leading mobile operators in the UK, with a share of around 25%, alongside VMED O2 (28%)<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Telefonica-SA-credit-rating-734508"> </a>, followed by <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Vodafone-Group-Plc-credit-rating-600018164">Vodafone Group Plc </a> (Vodafone [Baa2 stable], 20%) and Three UK (a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/CK-Hutchison-Group-Telecom-Holdings-Limited-credit-rating-830941979">CK Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Limited </a> [CKHGT, Baa1 stable], 15%). In terms of mobile postpaid, BT is the market leader with a share of 29%. </p><Artifact id="23a51900-2a31-11ee-8d4a-029a6e7c0423"/><p><a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Telecommunications-United-Kingdom-Vodafone-Three-deal-is-positive-for-both-regulatory-Sector-Comment--PBC_1367854">In June 2023, Vodafone and CKHGT announced an agreement to combine their UK operations, Vodafone UK and Three UK </a>. We believe the proposed consolidation will lead to a healthier competitive environment and three major operators from four. However, the overall assessment will be driven mainly by the regulatory review and potential remedies required by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).  </p><h2>Ambitious fibre rollout plan aims to cover 85% of the UK's households by 2026 amid competitive pressure from altnets</h2><p>BT is targeting to roll out FTTP to 25 million premises by December 2026, or around 85% of the UK's households, from 11 million currently. BT increased its build rate to a record of around 3 million - 3.1 million premises passed over fiscal 2023 and 2024. <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Telecommunications-UK-BT-takes-lead-in-battle-for-UK-fibre-Sector-In-Depth--PBC_1366259">However, the company will need to increase its rollout rates even further to reach its target </a>. Importantly, BT's takeup of its full fibre services from its own divisions, as well as third-party internet service providers (ISPs), is still low at around 32% but is likely to increase towards 40% in March 2026 and expand gradually thereafter. As of June 2023, BT recorded 3.5 million FTTP connections (own and third party), up strongly from 2.4 million a year earlier. </p><p>Accelerated fibre build by operators led to a substantial increase of 54% in full fibre coverage as of July 2023, according to third-party estimates, improving strongly from that a year earlier (July 2022: 38%). We expect fibre investments to continue over the next three years, supporting the UK's full fibre coverage position, which has historically lagged that of other European countries. However, the continued fibre rollout by multiple operators has led to an inevitable increase in overbuild, which is likely to increase further in the upcoming years.  </p><p>In our view, the upgrade to FTTP is an essential tool for the company to fend off competition from VMED O2 and alternative network providers (altnets), such as CityFibre Holdings Limited, which have stepped up their fibre rollout plans in recent years. <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Telecommunications-UK-BT-takes-lead-in-battle-for-UK-fibre-Sector-In-Depth--PBC_1366259">A number of altnets are facing increasing difficulties in achieving their targets because of higher interest rates and inflation </a>. Despite these challenges and the potential for some of their targets to be revised or missed, altnets are still building networks, a continued threat to the main operators, such as BT.  </p><p>In this context, BT expects to lose around 400,000 broadband lines, or approximately 2% of the overall base, over fiscal 2024 (the first quarter of 2024: 126,000) because of continued infrastructure competition. BT is attempting to retain ISP customers, such as Sky, TalkTalk and Vodafone, and drive full fibre adoption through a series of incentives embedded in its Equinox 2 offering. Incentives are aimed at full fibre connections and include discounts, as well as more favourable indexation terms, among other factors<sup><a href="#endnote2" id="endnoteref2">2 </a> </sup> </p><h2>Consumer and Openreach to drive modest revenue growth over fiscal 2024-25; Business drag to gradually decline</h2><p>We forecast pro forma revenue growth of around 1.5% in fiscal 2024, driven mainly by the price increases introduced in Consumer (14.4%) and Openreach (approximately 11%) over the year. The positive evolution of Consumer and Openreach will be, however, to some extent offset by continued pressures in Business. Moving into fiscal 2025, we expect lower revenue growth of around 0.5%, as the positive impact from price increases reduces and the B2B revenue decline moderates. </p><p>On a reported basis, the overall evolution will be weaker in fiscal 2024, reflecting the <a href="https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1328859">deconsolidation of BT Sports and the creation of a content JV </a> with <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Inc-credit-rating-600057551/summary">Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. </a> (Discovery, Baa3 stable)<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Inc-credit-rating-600057551/summary" title="www.moodys.com"> </a>. </p><p>While most operators have annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) + [3.7%-3.9%] increases embedded in contracts, resulting in a price increase of more than 14% over March-April 2023, the overall impact on revenue of BT and the other operators will be modest. This is because out-of-contract customers typically seek to renegotiate the pricing of their contract with the current operator, sometimes also with the downgrade of their offer, or seek an alternative among competitors. Moreover, a number of customers will be affected by the price increase only when they are out of their initial limited discounts.  </p><p>In this context, the market remains highly promotional, particularly in the low end of the market for broadband speeds of around 50 Mbps. As Exhibit 5 shows, revenue growth of BT Consumer, VMED O2 and Vodafone showed a mixed picture after the implementation of price increases. In case of BT, growth rates were strong. However, in line with the trends in the previous fiscal period, they will gradually decline over time.  </p><Artifact id="e66a54b4-2c7f-11ee-8d4a-029a6e7c0423"/><h2>EBITDA growth to slow down in fiscal 2024-25</h2><p>We forecast company-adjusted EBITDA to grow towards £8.1 billion (+1%) in fiscal 2024, slightly above the pro forma fiscal 2023 levels. The positive impact of revenue growth over the year will be to some extent offset at the EBITDA level by inflationary pressures in terms of energy and staff, reflecting, however, the continued focus of the company on tight cost management. Moving into fiscal 2025, the overall trajectory will be broadly aligned with top-line growth (0.8%), and EBITDA is forecast to be more than £8.1 billion.   </p><p>On a Moody's-adjusted basis, the evolution of EBITDA will be moderately different because we have started to expense specific items. This is because they appear as recurring costs in the context of the company's ongoing cost-saving efforts. We currently expect specific items to amount to around £450 million in fiscal 2024 and £300 million in fiscal 2025 (fiscal 2023: £556 million), moderately higher than our previous assumption.   </p><p>There will be a significant slowdown in organic EBITDA growth in both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 compared with that in fiscal 2023. Over fiscal 2023, organic revenue growth and, particularly, tight cost management drove growth of around 3% to £8.0 billion from £7.8 billion a year earlier. EBITDA growth over the year was particularly relevant in the context of rising energy costs and the phasing out of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with Virgin Mobile after the creation of VMED O2. </p><p>BT is undertaking a cost optimisation programme focused on digitisation, automation and product portfolio optimisation, among others, which aims to record £3 billion of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025 at an expected cost of £1.6 billion. As of the end of March 2023, £2.1 billion of gross annualised savings had been achieved with £1.1 billion of costs incurred to date. </p><h2>Weak cash flow generation as capital spending and pension deficit payments remain high </h2><p>We forecast capital spending to remain high at around £5,100 million in fiscal 2024, in line with the high end of BT's guidance, and £5,250 million in fiscal 2025, driven by BT's continued acceleration of the fibre rollout (fiscal 2023: £5.0 billion, excluding capital accruals of £0.3 billion). <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Telecommunications-UK-BT-takes-lead-in-battle-for-UK-fibre-Sector-In-Depth--PBC_1366259">There is a risk that capital spending could be higher than BT expects through 2026 because the company needs to accelerate its fibre rollout rate from the current levels to hit its target as inflation continues to bite </a>. However, BT retains levers to keep its capital spending within guidance.  </p><p>In terms of shareholder distribution, the current dividend policy is likely to remain unchanged, leading to an outflow of around £750 million in each of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. Overall cash flow generation will also remain constrained by the pension deficit repayments (see Exhibit 6), although at a lower level compared with that in fiscal 2023.  </p><Artifact id="ff3e8ffc-2caa-11ee-8d4a-029a6e7c0423"/><p>As a result of high capital spending, pension deficit payments and sustained dividend distributions, BT's cash flow generation will remain constrained over fiscal 2024-25. Other key factors in BT's cash flow profile over the period include the sustained level of restructuring charges, possible sale of handset receivables and potential cash outflows related to the minimum revenue guarantee for the BT Sport JV. This should lead to Moody's-adjusted RCF/net debt of 27% and 26% in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, respectively (fiscal 2023: 28%).  </p><h2>Leverage is likely to remain stable and commensurate with Baa2 requirements</h2><p>BT's Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA was 3.3x in fiscal 2023 (see exhibit 14 in the appendix), up substantially from the fiscal 2022 level (3.0x). This deterioration was driven mainly by an increase in the company's IAS19 pension deficit (see Exhibit 7), as well as our change in the treatment of specific items, in spite of good underlying EBITDA growth. </p><Artifact id="ca4a362e-2cab-11ee-8d4a-029a6e7c0423"/><p>We expect Moody's-adjusted leverage to be around 3.3x in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, broadly flat versus fiscal 2023 levels. Despite our forecast of an EBITDA improvement over the same time frame, we forecast gross leverage to remain stable because of our assumption of increasing debt to fund the ongoing FTTP rollout.  </p><p>Although we recognise that the pension deficit will remain subject to volatility, the improving operating performance in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025, as well as large pension deficit contributions, should help contain Moody's-adjusted leverage below the 3.5x downgrade guidance for BT's Baa2 rating over the next 24 months. We expect that BT will announce the update of its triennial funding valuation in the first half of 2024.  </p><p>Leverage could potentially benefit from the increasing use of hybrid notes issuance to refinance or raise existing or new debt. <a href="https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1125264">Hybrid instruments qualify for 50% equity treatment, for the purpose of calculating Moody's-adjusted ratios </a>. </p><p>In this context, BT issued £700 million of hybrid notes in June 2023 for general corporate purposes to diversify funding and to support credit metrics. The company continues to target a Baa1 credit rating over the medium term while executing high investments in the network.  </p><p>BT has maintained a large cash balance — supported by short-term investments — over the last three years, which mitigated the negative impact of high leverage. Moody's-adjusted net debt/EBITDA was 2.8x in fiscal 2023, 0.5x lower than that on a gross basis. </p>""",

As Exhibit 4 shows below, in broadband, BT has an estimated 34% share of the UK market followed by Sky Limited (part of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Comcast-Corporation-credit-rating-600067485/summary">Comcast Corporation </a> [A3 stable], with an estimated share of 23%); <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/VMED-O2-UK-Holdings-Limited-credit-rating-868059631/summary">VMED O2 UK Holdings Limited </a> (VMED O2 [Ba3 stable], the 50:50 joint-venture between <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Liberty-Global-plc-credit-rating-823474225/summary">Liberty Global Plc </a> [Ba3 stable] and <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Telefonica-SA-credit-rating-734508/summary">Telefonica S.A. </a> [Baa3 stable], with a 20% stake); and TalkTalk Telecom Group Limited (TalkTalk, 10%). Although BT remains the leader in the UK broadband market, its market share reduced over the past five years amid strong competition.  </p><p>After the acquisition of EE, BT is also one of the leading mobile operators in the UK, with an around 25% share, alongside VMED O2 UK (28%)<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Telefonica-SA-credit-rating-734508"> </a>, followed by <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Vodafone-Group-Plc-credit-rating-600018164">Vodafone Group Plc </a> (Vodafone [Baa2 stable], 20%) and Three UK (a subsidiary of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/CK-Hutchison-Group-Telecom-Holdings-Limited-credit-rating-830941979">CK Hutchison Group Telecom Holdings Limited </a> [Baa1 stable], 15%). </p><Artifact id="f468d388-9bed-11ed-a3f9-dd678cf28d2a"/><p>Fixed mobile convergence has been slower in the UK than in other European countries and accounted for only 22% of BT's total consumer households as of September 2022, largely in line with March 2022 levels. Nevertheless, BT is well positioned to benefit from further convergence, particularly given its announcement in April 2022 to make EE its primary consumer brand. BT's ongoing efforts to push convergence could be, however, hampered by the efforts of other operators, such as VMED O2, to accelerate convergence. </p><h2>Ambitious fibre rollout plan aims to cover 85% of the UK's households by 2026 amid competitive pressure from AltNets</h2><p>BT is targeting to roll out FTTP to 25 million premises by December 2026, or around 85% of the UK's households, from nine million currently. To reach this target, BT increased its build rate to a record of around 800 thousand premises passed in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, implying an annual run rate of 3.2 million premises passed. Importantly, BT experiences a strong takeup of its fibre services from its own customer-facing divisions, as well as third-party communications providers. As of September 2022, BT recorded 2.4 million FTTP connections (own and third-party), up strongly from 1.3 million a year earlier. </p><p>Accelerated fibre build by operators led to a substantial increase of 45% in full-fibre coverage as of the end of 2022, according to third party estimates, improving strongly from a year earlier (December 2021: 30%). We expect fibre investments to continue over the next three years, supporting the UK's full-fibre coverage positioning, which has historically lagged that of other European countries. Ongoing fibre rollout by multiple operators has led, however, to an inevitable increase in overbuild, which we expect to increase further in the upcoming years.  </p><p>The upgrade to FTTP is an essential tool for the company to fend off competition from VMED O2 and alternative network providers (AltNets), which have stepped up their fibre rollout plans over recent years. VMED O2, for instance, is targeting to upgrade its mostly hybrid coaxial cable network to FTTP by 2028, covering 16 million premises or slightly more than 50% of the households in the UK. In this context, BT is attempting to retain internet service providers (ISP) customers, such as Sky Limited, Vodafone and TalkTalk, and push full-fibre adoption through a series of incentives embedded in its Equinox 2 offering.  </p><p>Incentives are aimed at full-fibre connections and include discounts, as well as more favourable indexation terms, among others. While incentives imply less favourable terms for BT compared with the previous pricing structure, they will nevertheless accelerate volume migration to FTTP at rental prices that remain substantially higher than copper and fibre-to-the-cabinet (FTTC) levels. Moreover, we see this initiative as a moderately defensive move to reduce competitive pressure from AltNets and lock in major customers. Unlike Openreach and most AltNets, VMED O2 has so far not provided competitors with access to its network; however, an upgrade to FTTP will help the company to eventually open it up.  </p><h2>Modest revenue growth likely in fiscal 2023-24 on price increases in Consumer and Openreach; B2B challenges to persist</h2><p>We expect pro forma revenue growth (that is, excluding the impact from the deconsolidation of BT Sports from September 2022) of around 0.5% in fiscal 2023, largely on the price increases introduced in Consumer and Openreach over the year. The positive evolution of Consumer and Openreach will be, however, largely offset by continued pressures in B2B (Enterprise and Global). Moving into fiscal 2024, we forecast stronger pro forma revenue growth at around 2%, still driven by price increases at Consumer and Openreach but also a moderation in the rate of decline in B2B. </p><p>On a reported basis, the overall evolution will be weaker in fiscal 2023-24, reflecting the deconsolidation of BT Sports and the creation of a content JV with <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Inc-credit-rating-600057551/summary">Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. </a> (Discovery, Baa3 stable)<a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Warner-Bros-Discovery-Inc-credit-rating-600057551/summary" title="www.moodys.com"> </a><sup><a href="#endnote1" id="endnoteref1">1 </a> </sup>. The creation of the JV will reduce BT Group's revenue by £500 million-£600 million per year, lowering its reported revenue for fiscal 2023 by roughly £300 million-£350 million and by an additional £200 million-£250 million for fiscal 2024 . </p><p>As per Exhibit 5, while most operators have annual Consumer Price Index (CPI) + [3.7%-3.9%] increases embedded into contracts, with pricing adjustments taking effect from the end of March based on the January CPI of that year, it might be difficult for struggling customers to digest a price increase of 14.4% based on current inflation levels.  </p><p>BT and Three UK recently confirmed Consumer prices will rise by this level while it is currently unclear whether the other operators will follow suit. In the case of BT, the company is going to freeze the price of selected services including landline-only customers, amongst others. This implies that 3 million customers will not be affected by the price increase. Openreach will also push CPI-linked increases of around 11% to roughly 70% of its revenue perimeter from January 2023.  </p><p>There could be upside pressure to our estimates if BT is ultimately able to implement the recently announced price increases based on the current inflation levels. The UK market remains, however, highly promotional, particularly in broadband, and competition might to a large extent be offset the positive impact of price increases. Moreover, the UK government and the regulator remain focused on the issue of affordability representing an additional source of potential risk for BT. </p><Artifact id="8b36909c-9366-11ed-97f4-83b4e186a890"/><pagebreak layout="portrait_flow"> </pagebreak><h2>More positive revenue trend, together with cost savings, will support EBITDA growth in fiscal 2023-24</h2><p>We expect BT's company-adjusted EBITDA to amount to around £7.9 billion in fiscal 2023, in line with the company's guidance. Improvement over the year (fiscal 2022: £7.3 billion) will be largely a function of organic revenue growth and, particularly, tight cost management. EBITDA growth over the year is particularly relevant in the context of rising energy costs (a negative impact of £200 million) and the phasing out of the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) agreement with Virgin Mobile (£100 million) after the creation of VMED O2.  </p><p>Moving into fiscal 2024, we expect overall company-adjusted EBITDA of around £7.9 billion-£8.0 billion as positive revenue contribution will be somewhat offset by our assumption of rising staff<sup><a href="#endnote2" id="endnoteref2">2 </a> </sup> and energy costs. According to management guidance, BT is 85% and 50% hedged on energy costs for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, respectively. </p><p>BT is undertaking a cost-optimisation programme focused on digitisation, automation and product portfolio optimisation, among others, which aims to record £3 billion of cost savings by the end of fiscal 2025, recently upsized by £500 million, at an expected cost of £1.6 billion. As of the end of September 2022, £1.7 billion of gross annualised savings had been delivered with £0.9 billion of costs incurred to date.  </p><p>On a Moody's-adjusted basis, the evolution of EBITDA will be moderately different as we will start expensing future specific items. This is because they appear as recurring costs in the context of the company's ongoing cost-saving efforts. We currently expect specific items to amount to around £400 million in fiscal 2023 and £300 million in fiscal 2024.  </p><h2>High capital spending and pension deficit payments will continue to constrain cash flow generation</h2><p>We currently forecast capital spending will remain high at around £5 billion and £4.9 billion in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, respectively, driven by BT's ongoing acceleration in fibre rollout. In terms of shareholder distribution, the current dividend policy will likely remain unchanged, leading to an outflow of around £750 million in each of fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024. Overall cash flow generation will also remain constrained by the pension deficit repayments, as Exhibit 6 shows below.  </p><Artifact id="bbea0aec-97fe-11ed-b914-2262022db558"/><p>While our assumption of improving EBITDA in fiscal 2023-24 will support BT's free cash flow generation, the deconsolidation of BT Sports and the subsequent creation of the JV with Discovery might hamper working capital patterns over the next three years because of the minimum revenue guarantee agreement over the next four years. This should lead to Moody's-adjusted retained cash flow/net debt of 29% and 26% in fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024, respectively (fiscal 2022: 34%).  </p><h2>Leverage to remain commensurate with the levels required for the current rating; pension deficit will likely be volatile</h2><p>BT's Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA was 3.0x in fiscal 2022 and for the 12 months that ended September 2022, down substantially from the fiscal 2021 level (3.7x). This improvement was mainly driven by a reduction in the company's IAS19 pension deficit, as Exhibit 7 shows, as well as by EBITDA growth. </p><Artifact id="9162ec3a-97fe-11ed-b914-2262022db558"/><p>We currently expect Moody's-adjusted leverage to be around 3.2x in fiscal 2023 and 3.3x in 2024. Despite our forecast of an EBITDA improvement over the same time frame, we forecast gross leverage to deteriorate because of a potential increase in debt levels to fund the ongoing FTTP rollout. </p><p>Although we recognise that the pension deficit will remain subject to volatility, the improving operating performance in fiscal 2023 as well as large pension deficit contributions should help contain Moody's-adjusted leverage below the 3.5x downgrade guidance for BT's Baa2 rating over the next 12-18 months. Such volatility could arise from a decrease in growth assets, among other factors. </p><p>Leverage could potentially benefit from increasing use of hybrid notes issuance to refinance or raise existing or new debt. The $1,000 million hybrid securities due 2081 and the inaugural €500 million hybrid securities due 2080 are deeply subordinated obligations ranking senior only to common shares, pari passu with preference shares, and junior to all senior and subordinated debt. They thus qualify for 50% equity treatment, for the purpose of calculating Moody's-adjusted ratios<sup><a href="#endnote3" id="endnoteref3">3 </a> </sup>. </p>""",

    "<h2>Tesla to maintain its lead in battery electric vehicle segment after ramp up of production capacity</h2><p>Tesla will maintain its leading position in battery electric vehicles, after it swiftly expanded its manufacturing footprint in the US, China and Europe. We estimate that Tesla will deliver nearly 1.8 million vehicles in 2023, a 34% increase compared to the 1.3 million vehicles that it delivered in 2022, and nearly double the deliveries in 2021. Considerable investments in new production facilities in Berlin and Austin enable the steep increase in vehicle deliveries, along with an expansion of the production capacity in Shanghai, and higher utilization of the manufacturing facility in Fremont. Tesla's aggregate annual production capacity is currently more than 1.9 million vehicles. </p><p>We anticipate that Tesla will maintain an aggressive plan to expand capacity and grow deliveries, in order to maintain its lead in the market. In addition to the swift increase in vehicle manufacturing capabilities, Tesla is also ramping up the production of battery cells for its most advanced battery, named '4680' after the dimensions of its cylindrical shape. </p><p>At the same time, other automakers are accelerating their transition to electric vehicles. The rapid increase in battery electric vehicles that are launched in the next two years could pose a threat to Tesla's growth prospects. However, we believe that the availability of these models remains limited in the next 12 months, at least outside China. Production volumes are constrained partially due to available battery capacity. Tesla has likely secured the largest battery cell capacity at this time because it started planning for a steep production increase at a much earlier stage. </p><p>To date, Tesla is dependent on primarily two models, the Model 3 and the Model Y. Furthermore, the Model 3 has yet to see a material refresh since its introduction in 2017. Tesla's vehicle line-up is expanding, however. Tesla's Class 8 semi-truck is in early production and the company delivered the first semi-truck in December. In addition, Tesla expects to enter early production for the new Cybertruck later in 2023. </p><h2>Profit margin set to compress, but to remain at industry-leading level</h2><p>We project Tesla's EBITA margin to decrease to 15.8% in 2023, down from our estimate of 18.9% for 2022. The expected decrease in margin reflects the considerable price reductions that Tesla initiated for several models in China, the US, and Europe. We believe that the price reductions in China were prompted by the expiration of tax credits for New Electric Vehicles, an increasingly competitive offering from other automakers, and slower economic growth prospects in China. More broadly, Tesla sees the price reductions as a means to make its vehicles more affordable to a larger group of consumers, in particular against the backdrop of slowing economic growth. In addition, we think that some of the price reductions in the US help Tesla to set its manufacturer suggested retail price below the maximum price for vehicles that qualify for the clean vehicle tax credit of the Inflation Reduction Act. Our assumptions resulted in a decrease in the average selling price per vehicle of about 10%. </p><p>Other factors that will weigh on margins in 2023 - albeit more modestly - are the tooling and production start of the Cybertruck, as well as the gradual production ramp of the Tesla Semi. </p><p>The impact of the assumed price reductions on the (automotive) gross margin will be partially mitigated by the operational leverage ensuing from the continuing steep increase in vehicle production. In addition, Tesla remains intensely focused on enhancing the efficiencies of its manufacturing process, for both vehicles and battery cells. The use of front and rear body castings in conjunction with a structural battery pack, for example, increases manufacturing efficiencies, because it eliminates a large number of separate components that otherwise would have to be assembled. A decrease in certain commodity costs, along with lower logistics costs, will also help mitigate the pressure on the (automotive) gross margin. </p><p>In view of its investments in domestic battery cell manufacturing capacity, Tesla will also benefit from the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for the production of battery cells. On a preliminary basis, Tesla estimated these benefits to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in 2023. </p><p>Despite our expectation for margin compression, we project EBITA in 2023 to be in line with 2022, because of the increase in vehicle deliveries that we expect. </p><p>Tesla's EBITA margin widened notably in 2021 and 2022. We attribute the margin increase to the company's increasing scale, the production ramp-up at its lower cost Shanghai Gigafactory and a shift in product mix with an increasing proportion of the Model Y. Price increases in certain regions and a return to positive margin for the Model S also helped increase the profitability. </p><h2>Outstanding debt limited to modest amount of non-recourse debt</h2><p>We expect Tesla to continue to operate with low financial leverage, after the company repaid more than $8 billion of debt in the last two years. With ample cash and very considerable free cash flow, Tesla does not have any external funding needs, despite a marked step-up in investments since 2021. </p><p>Tesla's non-recourse debt could increase if the company were to utilize the ABS market for product specific financing. Non-recourse debt was $2.0 billion as of December 31, about 80% of which were automotive asset-backed notes. </p><p>Debt/EBITDA dropped to only 0.3 times at year-end 2022, in our estimates.  </p>"

Our assumptions resulted in a decrease in the average selling price per vehicle of about 8%. </p><p>Other factors that will weigh on margins in 2023 - albeit more modestly - are the tooling and production start of the Cybertruck, as well as the gradual production ramp of the Tesla Semi. </p><p>The impact of the assumed price reductions on the (automotive) gross margin will be partially mitigated by the operational leverage ensuing from the continuing steep increase in vehicle production. In addition, Tesla remains intensely focused on enhancing the efficiencies of its manufacturing process, for both vehicles and battery cells. The use of front and rear body castings in conjunction with a structural battery pack, for example, increases manufacturing efficiencies, because it eliminates a large number of separate components that otherwise would have to be assembled. A decrease in certain commodity costs, along with lower logistics costs, will also help mitigate the pressure on the (automotive) gross margin. </p><p>In view of its investments in domestic battery cell manufacturing capacity, Tesla will also benefit from the tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act for the production of battery cells. On a preliminary basis, Tesla estimated these benefits to be in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter in 2023. </p><p>Despite our expectation for margin compression, we project EBITA in 2023 to be in line with 2022, because of the increase in vehicle deliveries that we expect. </p><p>Tesla's EBITA margin widened notably in 2021 and 2022. We attribute the margin increase to the company's increasing scale, the production ramp-up at its lower cost Shanghai Gigafactory and a shift in product mix with an increasing proportion of the Model Y. Price increases in certain regions and a return to positive margin for the Model S also helped increase the profitability. </p><h2>Outstanding debt limited to modest amount of non-recourse debt</h2><p>We expect Tesla to continue to operate with low financial leverage, after the company repaid more than $10 billion of debt in the last three years. With ample cash, short-term investments, and very considerable free cash flow, Tesla does not have any external funding needs, despite a marked step-up in capital expenditures since 2021. Debt/EBITDA dropped to only 0.3 times at year-end 2022. </p><p>Tesla's non-recourse debt could increase if the company were to utilize the ABS market for product specific financing. Non-recourse debt was $2.0 billion as of December 31, about 80% of which were automotive asset-backed notes. </p>",

    """<h2>German economy to contract by 0.3% in 2023, followed by a gradual recovery in 2024</h2><p>Germany exited its winter recession as real GDP stagnated quarter-on-quarter in Q2 2023<sup><a href="#endnote2" id="endnoteref2">2 </a> </sup>, falling short of the modest expansion in the euro area of 0.3%. We expect Germany's growth will continue to lag in the second half of the year as well, resulting in a 0.3% GDP contraction for the year of 2023,<sup><a href="#endnote3" id="endnoteref3">3 </a> </sup> before seeing growth of 1.3% in 2024 (see Exhibit 5).  </p><p>We expect the economically important manufacturing sector to face some pains in the near term, as various surveys showed contraction in both current scenario and businesses' prospects. Still relatively high energy prices continue to weigh on energy intensive industries. External demand weakness and tighter monetary conditions are negatively affecting the German industry and the outlook for investment. Having said that, industrial activity is somewhat sustained by order backlogs. Car manufacturers in particular sharply increased their output in May, with the number of units almost back to the pre-pandemic levels observed in the last quarter of 2019. </p><p>Despite rising wages we project only weak private consumption growth in 2023, given that inflation rates remain high. We expect consumer price inflation (as measured by HICP)<sup><a href="#endnote4" id="endnoteref4">4 </a> </sup> to average 6.1% in 2023 (down from 8.7% in 2022) and decrease further to 3.0% in 2024. </p><p>Downside risks to our forecast remain with the onset of winter especially regarding potential gas shortages. According to the OECD, German gas consumption will have to decrease by around 20% to prevent shortages or significantly higher gas prices if temperatures drop below the winter average, despite currently abundant gas reserves and the construction of new LNG terminals. </p><p>The labor market remains very tight in Germany, with an unemployment rate of 3% at the end of the second quarter in 2023. Demand for skilled labor remains high, with high vacancy numbers in the economy. The demographic issues faced by the country exacerbates the issue as there is no availability of skilled labor to fill the roles. We expect the unemployment rate for 2023 to average around 3.2%, before dipping to 3.1% in 2024. </p><Artifact id="a08239d8-3050-11ee-a53a-5944116e8b40"/><h2>Energy support measures' costs will determine 2023 fiscal deficit size, gradual reduction from 2024 on</h2><p>After Germany's fiscal deficit eased to 2.7% of GDP in 2022 on the back of higher revenues outweighing fiscal support measures, we expect a slight decline in the deficit to 2.6% of GDP in 2023 as government support measures continue to add to spending, and the weaker economic performance will limit revenue growth. In line with the experience following the global financial crisis, we expect a return to gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024, mainly driven by reduced crisis support spending. The government presented its draft 2024 federal budget and 2025-27 financial plans in July, re-adhering to the constitutional debt brake from next year onwards<sup><a href="#endnote5" id="endnoteref5">5 </a> </sup>. At the same time, the changed energy supply situation and geopolitical environment in Europe will lead to structurally higher spending in areas like defence and energy transformation, largely funded through off-budget special funds. </p><p>Our forecast for 2023 is lower compared to government plans of a 4.3% deficit according to the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-04/German_SP_2023_en.pdf">German Stability Programme </a>, which includes costly estimations for the gas and electricity price brakes. Lower gas and electricity prices than those assumed in the Stability Programme will lead to lower spending from the off-budget Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF), which has €200 billion (or 5.2% of 2022 GDP) in spending earmarked for energy support measures (including the above mentioned energy price brakes) over 2022-24. As of June 2023, ESF borrowing stood at €59.9 billion<sup><a href="#endnote6" id="endnoteref6">6 </a> </sup>. </p><p>The announced rise in defence expenditure by the government, is only slowly gaining momentum due to long lead times for the purchase of military equipment, as well as bureaucratic hurdles. Borrowing of the €100 billion (or 2-6% of 2022 GDP) off-budget Armed Forces Special Fund (AFSF) stood at a mere €1.3 billion as of May 2023.  </p><p>For the federal government budget, revenues were up (+3.3%) despite tax relief measures and expenditures increased moderately (+0.6%) as of June 2023, with the financial balance standing at minus €47.8 billion. The Länder are currently in deficit – €9.8 billion as of May 2023 – as result of tax relief measures, while social security funds are broadly balanced.  </p><p>After falling to 66.1% of GDP in 2022 (down almost three percentage points compared to a year prior), we estimate that Germany's debt burden will remain stable this year, before resuming a gradual decline – supported by relatively strong nominal GDP growth – from 2024 onwards.  </p><Artifact id="5112af1e-3130-11ee-a53a-5944116e8b40"/><h2>Energy transition and spending pressures are leading to increased strains in the government coalition</h2><p>Increasing strains on government cohesion are reflected in the back and forth, particularly between the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), on a recent piece of climate legislation (<em>Gebäudeenergiegesetz </em>). Spending pressures in order to re-adhere to the debt-brake limits are adding to tensions, as reflected in a recent row between the Minister of Finance (FDP) and the Minister of Family Affairs (Greens) regarding the planned cut-down of parental leave benefits. However, none of the three government coalition parties (Social Democratic Party [SPD], Greens and FDP) has an incentive to trigger early elections given their standing in current polls. </p><p>The government also shifted its focus on policies aimed at supporting economic growth. The Ministry of Finance floated a plan for a law to strengthen growth opportunities, investments and innovation (<em>Wachstumschancengesetz </em>) mainly through tax reforms and the introduction of an investment premium, with overall tax reliefs amounting as high as € 5-6 billion (or 0.1% of GDP) yearly starting from 2025. The Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on the other hand put forward a proposal for the introduction of a subsidised electricity price (<em>Industriestrompreis </em>) for energy-intensive companies of €0.06 per kilowatt hour (kWh) until 2030, which is estimated to cost €25-30 billion over the said period.<sup><a href="#endnote7" id="endnoteref7">7 </a> </sup> We anticipate that the debate around the funding of these policy proposals will continue to test the cohesion among the coalition partners. </p><p>Opposition parties are benefiting from the tensions in the government coalition as recent opinion polls show that all three government coalition parties are losing voter support (SPD: 18%, Greens: 14% and FDP: 7%), with the centre-right party CDU/CSU leading polls (26%), followed by the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD, 21%). However, support for the CDU/CSU has been on a declining trend over the past months, while support for the AfD has been rising against the background of public debate about irregular migration, inflation and high energy prices as well as contentious climate legislation. While we continue to expect that the far right party will not play a role at the federal level in the foreseeable future, we note that CDU party head Friedrich Merz sparked a debate within his party about the possibility to engage with the AfD at the local level.      </p><pagebreak layout="portrait_flow"> </pagebreak>""",

German governments have demonstrated their ability to reverse debt trends in the past: in the context of German reunification, the low-growth environment of the early 2000s, and during the global financial crisis and euro area debt crisis.  </p><p>Historically low and stable inflation expectations that underpinned the monetary-policy credibility of the European Central Bank (ECB) are now being tested by high inflation levels. Rising interest rates and downside risks to the real economy pose risks to financial stability, most notably the potential underestimation of risks by market participants and vulnerabilities to negative developments in the German real estate market, particularly with respect to the commercial real estate sector. </p><p>The energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Germany's vulnerabilities and overreliance on Russian energy supplies, and led to a re-orientation of energy and defence policies. Like during the coronavirus pandemic, the German government has acted decisively through a range of measures such as the construction of new import infrastructure for liquified natural gas (LNG) and new legislation to accelerate the build-up of renewable energy sources, which demonstrate robust levels of institutional strength and an effective capacity to mitigate shocks. </p><p>Germany's <b>fiscal strength </b>score is "aa1". This reflects the sovereign's strong public finances and sound fiscal framework, with fiscal rules in place such as the constitutional debt brake. The German government has repeatedly posted fiscal surpluses over the period from 2012 to 2019, which compares favorably with most Aaa-rated peers. </p><p>After large deficits in 2020-21 due to the pandemic-induced recession and related fiscal measures, Germany's fiscal deficit eased to 2.7% of GDP in 2022 largely due to an increase in revenue, and the public debt ratio decreased to 66.1% of GDP from 69.0% in 2021. The size of fiscal deficits in 2023-24 is largely dependent on energy support measures, which hinge on the development of gas and electricity prices, but we project a gradual fiscal consolidation and reduction in the debt burden from 2024. </p><p>Because we classify Germany as reserve currency country<sup><a href="#endnote1" id="endnoteref1">1 </a> </sup>, we focus our assessment of its fiscal strength mainly on debt affordability. The ECB's interest rate hikes have led to higher borrowing costs for Germany, with interest payments likely reaching 1.3% of GDP by 2025 up from 0.7% in 2022, a faster  increase than for peers given Germany's shorter average term to maturity. </p><p>Germany faces sizeable challenges in the future. Absent further reform in areas like public pensions, health and social care, but also in the economy (the labour market, cuts in red tape and acceleration in planning and implementation processes), the total cost of ageing will rise to 27% of GDP by 2070, from around 23% in 2019, which is above the <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/European-Union-credit-rating-600049532/summary">EU </a> (Aaa stable) average. These costs will widen fiscal deficits and increase general government debt to well above 80% of GDP. </p><p>We assess the <b>susceptibility to event risk </b>for Germany at "baa", driven by political and banking sector event risks.  </p><p>We assess Germany's <em>susceptibility to political risk </em> as "baa", driven by geopolitical factors. The government's announcements in 2022 to ramp up defence spending reflects the changed geopolitical situation since February 2022. Germany's NATO membership is ultimately a guarantor of national security, but the country also faces contagion risks as it is bound by NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause, which treats an attack on any NATO member as an attack on all treaty signatories. The EU's Mutual Defence Clause (Article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty) would also apply if the conflict involved an EU country. While not our base case because of the deterrent effect of these clauses, the probability of such risks materializing have increased in light of the ongoing military conflict. </p><p>Regarding domestic political risk, like other highly developed democracies, Germany will face challenges in reaching a political consensus on economic and social security reforms that would adequately address the country's significant demographic challenges.  </p><p>Our assessment of <em>banking sector related event risk  </em>is "baa", reflecting moderate risks stemming from the potential crystallisation of contingent liabilities from the banking system on the government's balance sheet. </p><p>We assess <em>government liquidity risk  </em>and <em>external vulnerability risk  </em>as "aaa", supported by Germany's very strong capital market access and safe haven status, large current account surpluses, and a strongly positive net asset international investment position. </p>""",

    """<h2>Better-than-expected growth in 2022, improved outlook for 2023</h2><p>Germany's real GDP contracted by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter<sup><a href="#endnote2" id="endnoteref2">2 </a> </sup> (qoq) in Q4 2022, compared to a modest expansion in the euro area of 0.1%. However, full-year growth of 1.8% in 2022 was stronger than our expectation of only 1.4%, helped by government financial support, greater-than-expected flexibility in large parts of the industrial sector in diversifying energy sources and mild temperatures. For 2023, we forecast a stagnation in Germany's real GDP, a significant upward revision from -1.8% before, followed by a relatively weak recovery with only 1.2% real GDP growth in 2024 (see Exhibit 5). </p><p>We do not expect gas rationing during the current winter because of high storage levels and continued consumption savings. We also think that the risk of gas rationing in the coming winter has been reduced – albeit not entirely eliminated – given the diversification of import sources and build-up of LNG import capacity.  </p><p>Nevertheless, economic activity in Germany remains affected by high energy prices. Although inflation rates are decreasing (see below), high price levels and our expectation that nominal wage growth will not fully compensate for past price rises means that real incomes will continue to decline. This will weigh on private consumption growth, although energy subsidies for gas and electricity, tax measures, and transfer payments will provide support. We also think that despite signs of improving sentiment business investment growth will remain weak given tight financial conditions and elevated uncertainty.  </p><p>Higher-for-longer energy prices and demographic pressures weigh on Germany's growth potential and could weaken its economic strength over the longer term. Unfavourable demographics are reflected in a tight labour market, marked by low unemployment and high job vacancies. Official projections of potential growth for 2023-26 have been lowered to 0.8-0.9% and will decline further in the 2030s without faster progress on structural reforms (labour market, cuts in red tape, faster digitalization in the public sector and acceleration in planning and implementation processes). </p><Artifact id="b8af0172-a931-11ed-9162-e21afdc27952"/><h2>High headline inflation rates will moderate only gradually, core inflation to creep up further</h2><p>Germany's harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) increased by 8.7% during 2022, after 3.2% in 2021, outpacing the euro area average for the second year in a row. Monthly inflation rates seem to have peaked at 11.6% year-on-year (yoy) in October 2022, and have declined every moth since then reaching 9.2% in January, but continue to stay above the euro area average. Core inflation rates (excluding energy and unprocessed food) have also risen sharply and averaged 5% in 2022, more than double the 2.3% increase in 2021 (see Exhibit 6).  </p><p>We expect continued easing in monthly inflation rates throughout 2023. Gas and electricity subsidies will come into force from 1 March 2023 and oil prices will show large year-on-year declines throughout most of 2023, which will lower energy-related inflation. While there have been signs of declining prices in certain food items, price increases will likely continue for a couple of months for longer-lasting consumption goods and many services like health and hospitality. We expect average annual inflation of 6.2% in 2023, before falling to 3.1% in 2024. </p><p> </p><Artifact id="e288566c-a934-11ed-9162-e21afdc27952"/><h2>Wider fiscal deficit and higher debt burden in 2023, gradual reduction from 2024 on</h2><p>Germany's fiscal deficit eased to 2.6% of GDP in 2022 largely due to an increase in revenue and despite the additional government spending in response to the energy crisis. While coronavirus-related spending has largely been phased out, government support related to the energy crisis is adding to fiscal spending, which together with a stagnating economy will increase the fiscal deficit to 3% of GDP in 2023. However, the size of the actual deficit is largely dependent on energy support measures (which extend into 2024), which hinge on the development of gas and electricity prices. Given the significant reduction in gas prices from their 2022 peak, the costs of the gas price brake will likely be lower than the planned €40 billion (or 1% of GDP) for 2023. </p><p>In line with the experience following the global financial crisis, we expect a return to gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024, mainly driven by reduced crisis support spending. At the same time, the changed energy supply situation and geopolitical environment in Europe will lead to structurally higher spending in areas like defence and energy transformation, largely funded through off-budget special funds. </p><p>We estimate that general government debt decreased to 66.8% of GDP in 2022 from 68.6% in 2021 (see Exhibit 7). After another uptick in 2023 to around 68%, strong nominal GDP growth will gradually reduce Germany's debt ratio to around 66% of GDP by 2026, which is above its 2019 low, and the median of around 45% for Aaa-Aa1 rated peers. </p><Artifact id="61ca84dc-a943-11ed-9162-e21afdc27952"/><p> </p><pagebreak layout="portrait_flow"> </pagebreak>""",

The company manages its internal cash needs with its significant cash holdings and a commercial paper program. Apple's outstanding commercial paper borrowings at the end of fiscal quarters ranged from $5 billion to $11 billion over the last two years. Apple does not have a backstop liquidity facility and it relies instead on its cash and investments balances to manage commercial paper maturities. The company does not disclose its domestic cash and liquid investments position. The lack of a committed backstop liquidity facility is unusual among U.S. non-financial corporate issuers but Apple maintains substantial cash balances. At FYE '22, Apple had $18.5 billion of cash and $2.9 billion in money market funds. We expect Apple to maintain strong balances of funds with same day access relative to commercial paper maturities. The principal uses of excess cash and liquidity are share repurchases. Apple spent $90 billion on share repurchases in FY '22. Apple had $11 billion of current portion of term debt and $5.3 billion of tax liabilities related to the US tax reform act of 2017 due in FY '23.  </p><pagebreak layout="portrait_flow"> </pagebreak>""",
    """<h2>Exceptional liquidity, robust profitability and stability from financial policy</h2><p>Apple's exceptionally strong cash balances, low gross financial leverage, and our projections of $88 billion of free cash flow provide the company substantial flexibility to manage its business risks, make large investments in growth opportunities, and fund shareholder returns. We expect operating income to be flattish in FY '23, after robust growth of 64% and 10% in FY '21 and FY '22, respectively. In FY '23, revenue and profitability will face significant headwinds from the strong US Dollar, macroeconomic uncertainty, and supply chain constraints.   </p><Artifact id="e688541c-74a8-11ed-92c7-63f4ecb53c09"/><p>Apple maintained gross leverage around 1.8x (Moody's adjusted, see Appendix) since US tax reform but solid EBITDA growth over the last two years and relatively stable debt levels have driven leverage down sharply to 1.1x at FYE '22. Assuming stable debt levels, we expect leverage to remain unchanged in FY '23. Over time, we expect the company to maintain gross leverage in the range of low to mid 1x through business and investment cycles, while maintaining a net cash to net cash neutral position. Apple has historically driven its product innovation largely through internal R&amp;D, which is sizeable at $26 billion. In contrast, the company's cumulative cash spending on acquisitions over the last five years was a modest $3.2 billion, consisting of numerous small acquisitions. Capital expenditures are relatively modest (3% to 4% of revenues).  </p><p>Apple had $49 billion of cash in excess of total reported debt at FYE '22, down from $66 billion a year ago. Apple's credit profile is strongly supported by the enhanced visibility into its capital allocation from management's financial policy goal of transitioning to a net cash neutral position over time. The company's historical pattern of share repurchases since US tax reform and its robust earnings and cash balances support our expectation that Apple will transition to a net cash neutral position gradually over the next 3 to 4 years.  </p><h2>Core strengths in innovation, design, and integration of technologies differentiate offerings in an intensely competitive industry</h2><p>Apple's products provide superior user experience with aesthetically designed products and unmatched integration of hardware with software and services that simplifies complex underlying technologies. All of its major hardware products are powered by its proprietary operating system platforms. Apple also tightly controls third party applications that run on its devices through App Store. The company has further distanced its products from competition with its internally designed ARM-based M1 and M2 processors families that power new Mac products and iPads, and the H-series chips in its AirPods. Apple's integration of operating system software and processors will become an even greater differentiating factor as future applications such as voice-enable digital assistants, rich gaming, 5G applications, and Augmented and Virtual Reality will require greater processing power, speed and efficient power management. Apple has rarely been the first to launch products but it has been highly successful in differentiating its offerings by simplifying technologies for consumers. It has successfully deployed this formula from its early Macintosh personal computer to the introductions of the iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods, and has extended that into new proprietary services such as Apple Pay, Apple Card, and the news, music and video streaming services, by leveraging its strong brand and large installed base that increase stickiness into its ecosystem.  </p><h2>Large installed base and a growing ecosystem of products and services increase long-term revenue visibility</h2><Artifact id="389ed0d2-74a9-11ed-92c7-63f4ecb53c09"/><p>Apple's large (and growing) installed base of devices increases visibility into sales opportunities from replacement and upgrade of devices and cross-selling of new services into the customer base. First-time buyers of iPhones, Macs, iPads, AirPods and Apple Watch products continue to drive growth in its installed base of these products. Apple's products provide superior customer experience that generates tremendous customer loyalty, as reflected its industry-leading customer satisfaction ratings. The company has a large growth opportunity from cross-selling additional products and services into its relatively affluent installed base. It has generated strong growth in its Wearables and Accessories segment from the sales of Apple Watch and AirPods, and its cloud services and third party subscriptions in its Services category. Apple's paid subscriptions of services have doubled in 3 years to more than 900 million at the end of FY '22, and its Services segment generated approximately $78 billion in annualized revenues. Apple's ecosystem of products and services enhance user experience and increase stickiness to the ecosystem. The stickiness mitigates Apple's risk from its high concentration of profits in the iPhone category and variability in sales in its hardware products.  </p><h2>Higher-value iPhones and 5G upgrade cycle will boost profitability in the mature iPhone segment </h2><p>We expect Apple's iPhone segment revenues and profitability to grow primarily from the increasing mix of higher-value, new models, and 5G devices. In FY '22, iPhone revenues grew 7% driven by sales of iPhone 14 family of products released in September/October 2021. While market shares in the smartphone industry can shift quickly, Apple has gained share of the global smartphone market over the last 3 years, based on IDC's data. We expect global smartphone unit sales to grow in the low single digits annually over the next 3 to 4 years, but the share of 5G-enabled smartphones should increase from about 50% currently to about 75% of global unit sales over this period. The expanding coverage of 5G wireless networks and incentives from wireless carriers will stimulate industry sales for 5G devices and support increases in average selling prices, before a growing number of 5G device suppliers begin to pressure profitability.   </p><h2>Strong growth in services will bolster profitability and reduce volatility in operating profits</h2><p>Apple's Services revenue growth slowed from the strong, 26% annual growth in F4Q '21, to 5% in F4Q '22. In F4Q '22, revenues were negatively impacted by 6% of currency headwinds and softness in the digital advertising business, which we expect to be pro-cyclical, and gaming services on the App Store. These headwinds are likely to persist in FY '23 given the slowing economic growth in Apple's key markets and the expected strength of the US Dollar in the near term. We expect constant currency growth in the low teens for the Services segment in FY '23. The Services segment had a gross profit margin of 72% in FY '22, nearly 2x that of the Products segment. Apple's Services gross margin benefits from its App Store business in which it recognizes commissions earned as net revenues and from the highly profitable licensing revenues from Google. Growth in the Services segment will continue to diversify Apple's revenues and gross profits. The company has rapidly expanded its own services that are competitively priced, and these services have a low penetration of the installed base. Price increases in certain first-party services will help revenue growth in FY '23. The company continues to experience a rapid growth in paid subscriptions as well as free or transaction accounts. The App Store's developer base and content is growing rapidly. The company last reported that its App Store ecosystem facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020, up 24% from a year ago, and that 90% of the billings and sales occurred outside of the App Store, largely consisting of sales of physical goods and services. App Store search advertising, which contributed to Services growth in FY '21 and the first half of FY '22, is currently a very small portion of Apple's Services revenues, but represents a large, high-growth opportunity with strong gross margins.  </p><h2>Wearables will maintain strong growth; Mac and iPad sales expected to modestly decline but they increase Apple's business diversity </h2><p>We expect revenue growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessory segment in the low teens percentages on a reported basis and high teens on a constant currency basis over the next 12 months, driven by growth in sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Both categories have low penetration rates and despite growing competition, there is a large opportunity for growth from increasing adoption rates in Apple's device user base. Apple's Mac and iPad categories had record sales after the pandemic driven by the strong demand from remote work and learning use cases. We expect low single digit revenue declines in both categories in FY '23, reflecting the strong US dollar, weakening consumer spending, and after very strong unit sales over the last two years. The strong growth in the installed base of these devices has increased revenue prospects from replacement and upgrade opportunities over the long term. While both iPad and Mac products have much lower gross margins than the iPhones, these product lines collectively generated $69 billion in revenues in FY '22, and enhanced Apple's product diversity, ecosystem and user engagement across platforms.   </p><h2>Intense competition, a product-centric business and concentration of manufacturing base increase risks despite Apple's solid track record of managing through challenges </h2><p>Apple faces intense competition across each of its product and service offerings. As a product-centric company, it has execution risks from short product life cycles, the need to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, and managing a large and complex supply chain with frequent product upgrades. Execution risks in ramping up production in its global operations at large scale and anticipating the right level of demand, is high. Demand for Apple's premium priced products is susceptible to macroeconomic conditions, and in foreign markets, additionally to changes in foreign exchange rates.  </p><p>Apple's products are primarily manufactured in China, which is also Apple's second largest market by revenues. Apple has largely side-stepped any adverse impact on its businesses from US – China trade disputes and its strong supply chain management over the years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate its world class risk management and resiliency of its operations. However, the growing tensions between China and the US, and increasing focus of the US and European nations on controlling semiconductor exports to China to preserve national security advantages which could lead to more export controls, increase risks for Apple's supply chain in China. Apple's primary manufacturing partner, Foxconn, which operates a large facility in China, is facing labor unrest. More generally, the pandemic has exposed vulnerabilities in global technology supply chains. Apple has been diversifying its manufacturing facilities and assembly operations outside of China but replicating the extensive supply chain outside of China at scale will likely be a multi-year effort and could require investments from Apple to directly or indirectly support its outsourcing partners in scaling manufacturing facilities outside of China.   </p><h2>Regulatory scrutiny and legal risks centered on App Store and licensing businesses represent paramount risks </h2><p>Regulatory uncertainties targeting large technology companies that operate in digital commerce markets have materially amplified in recent years. For Apple, these risks are primarily centered on certain parts of its Services segment. Apple's gross profit from the Services category has nearly doubled over the last 3 years and we expect Apple's share of gross profits from the Services category to continue to grow, increasing its business diversity and reducing earnings volatility. But its App Store business (part of the Services category) faces risks from new laws in the US and Europe aiming to promote competition in digital marketplaces and platforms, heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators in a number of countries, and private antitrust legal challenges in the US and Europe. In addition, Apple's licensing revenues (also part of Services revenues) that it generates from Google are under legal scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Google alleging that Google's agreements with device manufacturers, wireless carriers and browser developers that require Google's search engines to be preset as a default search engine, are exclusionary and anticompetitive. Under these agreements, Google pays substantial (and growing) amounts to its distribution partners. Apple does not break out its revenues from App Store and its licensing agreements with Google. We estimate that revenues from these businesses accounted for about half of Apple's Services revenues and an even larger share of gross profit for its Services segment. Given the significance of these revenue streams, regulatory and legal risks will remain Apple's principal risks until there is greater clarity about how legislative changes and regulatory actions could affect its highly profitable revenue streams. It is likely that the fog of uncertainty may not clear over the next several years given the history of antitrust cases. Apple's Aaa rating incorporates Moody's view of Apple's world class risk management capabilities, robust financial flexibility, and diversifying offerings, which should allow the company to preserve or strengthen its financial profile despite the regulatory challenges. Apple, along with other multinational corporations, could also face higher taxes on revenues generated outside their domestic jurisdictions as part of a global tax reform initiative. But we do not expect higher taxes on foreign revenues to have a meaningful impact on Apple's credit profile given its substantial profitability and cash flow.  </p><p>Regulations governing consumers' personal data and its use by digital platforms including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020, reflect heightened regulatory focus on this area. Apple describes data privacy as a fundamental human right. Apple's new releases of operating system software require software publishers to obtain permission from users to allow tracking of the users or access the device's advertising identifiers. These changes have upended the digital advertising industry's ability to serve targeted, performance ads and increased tensions between industry participants. The confluence of new regulations with varying standards in different jurisdictions and the lack of clarity in existing regulations about who owns consumers' data in digital businesses create an uncertain business environment for Apple and other digital businesses.  </p><p>Apple's information systems store personally identifiable information about the company's millions of customers and are increasingly used to authorize access to secure networks. Apple's pre-eminent business profile and brand reputation increases the risk of reputational harm or business disruptions from cybersecurity breaches although the company has not experienced any noteworthy lapses in this area. From a credit-risk perspective, management's commitment to its "core values" mitigate these social risks. Its core values focus on: (i) Accessibility to technology, (ii) Diversity and Inclusion, (iii) Education, (iv) Environment, (v) Privacy and Security, and, (vi) Supplier responsibility, and management has a track record of steadfastly supporting these objectives.  </p><p>In September 2020, the European Commission appealed to the court of final appeal in the European Union against a lower court's decision to annul European Commission's claim that Ireland granted state aid to Apple in assessing taxes on earnings from certain local subsidiaries. Apple had $12.7 billion of cash at FYE '22 that was restricted from general use while the dispute is pending.  </p>""",

The company is further distancing its products from competition with its internally designed ARM-based M1 and M2 processors that power a range of MacBooks and iPad products. Apple's integration of operating system software and processors will become an even greater differentiating factor as future applications such as voice-enable digital assistants, rich gaming, 5G applications, and Augmented and Virtual Reality will require greater processing power and speed. Apple has rarely been the first to launch products but it has been highly successful in differentiating its offerings by simplifying technologies for consumers. It has successfully deployed this formula from its early Macintosh personal computer to the introductions of the iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods, and has extended that into new proprietary services such as Apple Pay, Apple Card, and the news, music and video streaming services, by leveraging its strong brand and large installed base that increase stickiness into its ecosystem.   </p><h2>Large installed base and a growing ecosystem of products and services increase long-term revenue visibility </h2><Artifact id="b70d0788-f3e7-11ec-8f34-541f8015d063"/><p>Apple's installed base of devices increases visibility into sales opportunities from replacement and upgrade of devices in the installed base. First-time buyers of iPhones, Macs, iPads, AirPods and Apple Watch products continue to drive growth in its installed base of these products. Apple's products provide superior customer experience that generates tremendous customer loyalty, as reflected its industry-leading customer satisfaction ratings. Apple has a large growth opportunity from cross-selling additional products and services into its affluent installed base. It has generated strong growth in its Wearables and Accessories segment from the sales of Apple Watch and AirPods, and its cloud services and third party subscriptions in its Services category. Apple's paid subscriptions of services have doubled in less than 3 years to more than 825 million at the end of F2Q '22, and its Services segment generated approximately $80 billion in annualized revenues. Apple's ecosystem of products and services enhance user experience and increase stickiness to the ecosystem. The stickiness mitigates Apple's risk from its high concentration of profits in the iPhone category.   </p><h2>5G upgrade cycle poised to boost profitability in the mature iPhone segment </h2><p>We expect Apple's iPhone segment revenues and profitability to grow primarily from the increasing share of higher-value 5G devices over the next few years. According to IDC, global smartphone unit sales grew 6% in 2021, after declining ever year since 2016. We project growth in global smartphone unit sales to slow to the low single digits over the next 12 to 24 months, but the share of 5G-enabled smartphones will increase to more than 2/3rd of global smartphone unit sales over this period, from approximately 50% in 1Q 2021. The expanding coverage of 5G wireless networks and incentives from wireless carriers will stimulate industry sales for 5G devices over the next 2 to 3 years and support increases in average selling prices, before a growing number of 5G device suppliers begin to pressure profitability.  </p><h2>Strong growth in services will bolster profitability and reduce volatility in operating profits</h2><p>We expect Services revenue growth of approximately 13% and the share of Apple's gross profit from this segment to increase from 31% in FY '21, to about 36% in FY '23. The Services segment had average gross profit margin of 71% in the LTM F2Q '22 period, nearly 2x of the Products segment. Apple's strong Services gross margin benefit from its App Store business in which it recognizes commissions earned as net revenues and from the highly profitable licensing revenues from Google. Sustained growth in the Services segment will continue to diversify Apple's profitability. The company has rapidly expanded its own services and these services have a low penetration of the installed base. The App Store's developer base and content is growing rapidly. Apple reported that its App Store ecosystem facilitated $643 billion in billings and sales in 2020, up 24% from a year ago, and that 90% of the billings and sales occurred outside of the App Store, largely consisting of sales of physical goods and services. Advertising, which contributed to Services growth in FY '21 and YTD F2Q '22 period, is currently a very small portion of its Services revenues, but represents a high growth opportunity with strong gross margins.   </p><h2>Wearables will maintain strong growth while Mac and iPad sales expected to stabilize  </h2><p>We expect revenue growth in the Wearables, Home and Accessory segment in the mid teens percentages over the next 12 to 24 months, driven by growth in sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Both categories have low penetration rates and while competition is increasing, there is a large opportunity for growth from increasing adoption rates in Apple's device user base. Apple's Mac and iPad categories had record sales after the pandemic driven by the strong demand from remote work and learning use cases. But we expect flattish revenue growth in both categories over the next 12 to 18 months. However, the growth in the installed base of these devices has increased revenue prospects from replacement and upgrade opportunities over the long term. While both iPad and Mac products have much lower gross margins than the iPhones, these product lines collectively generated $69 billion in revenues in the LTM F2Q '22 period and enhanced Apple's product diversity, ecosystem and user engagement across platforms.   </p><h2>Intense competition and a product-centric business increase execution risks but Apple has a broad portfolio and a strong track record of managing challenges </h2><p>Apple's large scale and global operations increase its business risks but its strong supply chain management over the years and execution after the COVID-19 pandemic began to spread demonstrate its world class risk management and resiliency of its operations. The company faces intense competition across its product and service offerings. As a product-centric company, it has execution risks from short product life cycles, the need to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, and managing a large and complex supply chain with frequent product upgrades. Execution risks in ramping up production in its global operations at large scale, especially during new product introductions, and anticipating the right level of demand, is high. Demand for Apple's premium priced products is susceptible to macroeconomic conditions, and in foreign markets, additionally to changes in foreign exchange rates. In addition, Apple has a high concentration of manufacturing operations through its partners in China. China is also Apple's second largest market by revenues and Apple's strong rebound in revenues in China was a key contributor to its strong performance in FY '21. Apple has largely side-stepped any adverse impact on its businesses from US – China trade tensions, but it faces risks if trade relations between the two countries deteriorate. In the near-to-intermediate term, Apple additionally faces headwinds from component shortages, a stronger US Dollar, and its decision to stop sales in Russia since March '22. The decelerating economic growth in Apple's major markets increase the risks to durability of the strong consumer demand over the next 12 to 18 months.  </p><p>These risks are tempered by Apple's track record of execution over the years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company negotiated significant challenges after the outbreak of the coronavirus epidemic, including persistent component shortages, delays in new product rollouts, and closing of its retail stores and those of its distribution partners. Apple's operating income growth of 64% in FY '21 and 17% in YTD F2Q '22 benefited from the strong consumer spending on goods during the pandemic but it demonstrated solid execution and it benefited from the breadth of its products and services offerings and geographical revenue diversity. Apple refreshed all its major product lines during the pandemic, which contributed to its strong performance. In the flagship iPhone category, the new iPhone 12 and iPhone 13 families were launched in the shadow of the pandemic, and have proved highly successful. Apple now has the broadest choice of iPhones ever with a range of price points and features.  </p><h2>Legal and regulatory risks centered on App Store and licensing businesses represent paramount risks</h2><p>Regulatory uncertainties targeting large technology companies that operate in digital commerce markets have materially amplified in recent years. For Apple, these risks are primarily centered on certain parts of its Services segment. Apple's gross profit from the Services category has nearly doubled over the last 3 years and we expect Apple's share of gross profits from the Services category to continue to increase, increasing its business diversity and reducing earnings volatility. But its App Store business (part of the Services category) faces risks from new laws in the US and Europe aiming to promote competition in digital marketplaces and platforms, heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators in a number of countries, and private antitrust legal challenges in the US and Europe. In addition, Apple's licensing revenues (also part of Services revenues) that it generates from Google are under legal scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Google alleging that Google's agreements with device manufacturers, wireless carriers and browser developers that require Google's search engines to be preset as a default search engine, are exclusionary and anticompetitive. Under these agreements, Google pays substantial (and growing) amounts to its distribution partners.  </p><p>Apple does not break out its revenues from App Store and its licensing agreements with Google. We estimate that revenues from these businesses accounted for over half of Apple's Services revenues and an even larger share of gross profit for its Services segment. Given the significance of these revenue streams, regulatory and legal risks will remain Apple's principal risks until there is greater clarity about how legislative changes and regulatory actions could affect its highly profitable revenue streams. It is likely that the fog of uncertainty may not clear over the next several years given the history of antitrust cases. Apple's Aaa rating incorporates Moody's view of Apple's world class risk management capabilities, robust financial flexibility, and diversifying offerings, which should allow the company to preserve or strengthen its financial profile despite the regulatory challenges. Apple, along with other multinational corporations, could also face higher taxes on revenues generated outside their domestic jurisdictions as part of a global tax reform initiative. But we do not expect higher taxes on foreign revenues to have a meaningful impact on Apple's credit profile given its substantial profitability and cash flow.  </p><p>Regulations governing consumers' personal data and its use by digital platforms including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020, reflect heightened regulatory focus on this area. Apple describes data privacy as a fundamental human right. Apple's new releases of operating system software require software publishers to obtain permission from users to allow tracking of the users or access the device's advertising identifiers. These changes have upended the digital advertising industry's ability to serve targeted ads and has increased tensions between industry participants. The confluence of new regulations with varying standards in different jurisdictions and the lack of clarity in existing regulations about who owns consumers' data in digital businesses create an uncertain business environment for Apple and other digital businesses.  </p><p>Apple's information systems store personally identifiable information about the company's millions of customers and are increasingly used to authorize access to secure networks. Apple's pre-eminent business profile and brand reputation increases the risk of reputational harm or business disruptions from cybersecurity breaches although the company has not experienced any noteworthy lapses in this area. From a credit-risk perspective, management's commitment to its "core values" mitigate these social risks. Its core values focus on: (i) Accessibility to technology, (ii) Diversity and Inclusion, (iii) Education, (iv) Environment, (v) Privacy and Security, and, (vi) Supplier responsibility, and management has a track record of steadfastly supporting these objectives.  </p><p>In September 2020, the European Commission appealed to the court of final appeal in the European Union against a lower court's decision to annul European Commission's claim that Ireland granted state aid to Apple in assessing taxes on earnings from certain local subsidiaries. In our analysis of Apple's cash and marketable securities we exclude the $15.4 billion of cash at F2Q '22, that was restricted from general use while the dispute is pending.  </p>""",

Apple maintained gross leverage around 1.8x (Moody's adjusted, see Appendix) from FY '18 through FY '20 since US tax reform but robust EBITDA growth in FY '21 and FY '22 and relatively stable debt levels drove leverage down to 1.1x at FYE '22. Leverage was unchanged 1.1x at F3Q '23, as declining EBITDA was offset by lower debt and tax repatriation liability balances. Assuming stable debt levels, we expect EBITDA growth of 4% to drive a modest decline in gross leverage in FY '24. Over time, we expect the company to maintain gross leverage in the range of low to mid 1x through business and investment cycles, while maintaining a net cash to net cash neutral position. Apple has historically driven its product innovation largely through internal R&amp;D, which is sizeable at $29 billion. In contrast, the company's cumulative cash spending on acquisitions over the last five years was a modest $2.5 billion, consisting of numerous small acquisitions. Capital expenditures are relatively modest (3% to 4% of revenues).  </p><p>Apple had $57 billion of cash in excess of total reported debt at F3Q '23, compared to $60 billion a year ago. The company's credit profile is strongly supported by the enhanced visibility into its capital allocation from management's financial policy goal of transitioning to a net cash neutral position over time. Apple's historical pattern of share repurchases since US tax reform and its strong earnings and cash balances support our expectation that the company will transition to a net cash neutral position gradually over the next 4 to 5 years.  </p><h2>Core strengths in innovation, design, and integration of technologies differentiate offerings in an intensely competitive industry </h2><p>Apple's products provide superior user experience with aesthetically designed products and unmatched integration of hardware with software and services that simplifies complex underlying technologies. All of its major hardware products are powered by its proprietary operating system platforms. Apple also tightly controls third party applications that run on its devices through the App Store. The company has further distanced its products from competition with its internally designed ARM-based M-series processors that power new Mac products and iPads, and the H-series chips in its AirPods. Apple's integration of operating system software and processors will become an even greater differentiating factor as future applications such as artificial intelligence applications, rich gaming, and Augmented and Virtual Reality will require greater processing power, speed and efficient power management. Apple has rarely been the first to launch products but it has been highly successful in differentiating its offerings by simplifying technologies for consumers. It has successfully deployed this formula from its early Macintosh personal computer to the introductions of the iPhone, iPod, iPad, Apple Watch, and AirPods, and has extended that into new proprietary services such as Apple Pay, Apple Card, and the news, music and video streaming services, by leveraging its strong brand and penetrating its large installed base that also increase stickiness into its ecosystem.  </p><h2>Large installed base and a growing ecosystem of products and services increase long-term revenue visibility </h2><p> </p><Artifact id="860b481a-3e10-11ee-8011-691730dad563"/><p>Apple's large (and growing) installed base of devices increases visibility into sales opportunities from replacement and upgrade of devices and cross-selling of new services into the customer base. Consumers switching to iPhones and first-time buyers of Macs, iPads, AirPods and Apple Watch continue to drive growth in Apple's installed base. Apple's products provide superior customer experience that generates tremendous customer loyalty, as reflected its industry-leading customer satisfaction ratings. The company has a large growth opportunity from cross-selling additional products and services into its relatively affluent installed base. Apple's paid subscriptions of services have nearly doubled in last 3.5 years to more than 1 billion at F3Q '23, and its Services segment generated approximately $85 billion in annualized revenues. Apple's ecosystem of products and services enhance user experience and increase stickiness to the ecosystem. The stickiness mitigates Apple's risk from its high concentration of profits in the iPhone category and variability in sales in its hardware products.  </p><h2>An inflection in global smartphone sales and shift to higher-value iPhones will support profitability in the mature iPhone segment</h2><p>We expect global smartphone unit sales to grow 5% in 2024, after declining 5.5% in 2022, and 7% to 8% in 2023. We expect Apple's iPhone segment revenues and profitability to grow from the increasing mix of higher-value, new models, and 5G devices. iPhone 14 family of products released in September/October 2021 have strongly supported sales in the iPhone category and Apple's profitability and the new models are expected to be launched in September 2023. Apple has gained share of the global smartphone market over the last 3 years, based on IDC's data, partly benefiting from Huawei's share losses following the 5G export license restrictions imposed by the US. We expect global smartphone unit sales to grow in the low single digits annually over the next 3 to 4 years, but we expect the share of 5G smartphone units to increase from about 50% of total smartphone units sold in 2022, to more than 70% in 2024. The expanding coverage of 5G wireless networks and incentives from wireless carriers will stimulate industry sales for 5G devices and support increases in average selling prices, before a growing number of 5G device suppliers begin to pressure profitability.  </p><h2>Sustained growth in services will bolster profitability and reduce volatility in operating profits</h2><p>Apple's Services revenue growth decelerated from 27% and 14%, in FY '21 and FY '22, respectively, and to 7% in the YTD F3Q '23 period. The deceleration in revenue growth reflected the adverse foreign currency impact in the YTD F3Q '23 period, negative impact from macroeconomic conditions on advertising and gaming revenues from AppStore, and challenging comparisons against prior periods. On a constant currency basis we expect Services revenues to grow in the high single digits over the next 12 to 18 months driven by growth in paid subscriptions of Apple's digital services and higher contributions from macro-sensitive gaming, advertising and Apple Pay offerings. The Services segment had a gross profit margin of 71% in YTD F3Q '23 period, nearly 2x that of the Products segment. Apple's Services gross margin benefits from its App Store business in which it recognizes commissions as net revenues and from the highly profitable licensing revenues from Google. In the YTD F3Q '23 period, Services gross margins declined by 140 basis points as a result of weakening foreign currencies relative to the US Dollar, and we estimate negative impact from investments in original content for Apple TV+ offering. Apple's growing portfolio of services offerings and still low penetration of paid subscriptions relative to the installed base provides a large, long-term opportunity for growth in higher-margin services that will continue to diversify Apple's revenues and gross profits. The company continues to experience a rapid growth in paid subscriptions as well as free or transaction accounts. The App Store's developer base and content is growing rapidly. The company reported $1.1 trillion in developer billings and sales from App Store in 2022 ($643 billion in 2020), with 90% of the billings and sales occurring outside of the App Store, largely consisting of sales of physical goods and services. This reflects the substantial scale of the company's online commerce platform and user engagement that are growing rapidly.  </p><h2>Wearables will maintain strong growth; Mac and iPad are mature but they increase Apple's business diversity</h2><p>We expect revenues in the Wearables, Home and Accessory segment to grow 7% on a constant currency basis over the next 12 months, driven by growth in sales of Apple Watch and AirPods. Both categories have low penetration rates and despite growing competition, there is a large opportunity for growth from increasing adoption rates in Apple's device user base. Apple's Mac and iPad categories had record sales after the COVID-19 pandemic but demand began to decline in 2022. Mac and iPad revenues declined 12% and 4% in the LTM F3Q '23. In FY '24, we expect Mac revenues to grow mid-single digits and iPad revenues to decline low single digits, reflecting weak macroeconomic growth in Apple's key markets and mature end markets. While both iPad and Mac products have much lower gross margins than the iPhones, these product lines collectively generated $62 billion in revenues in the LTM F3Q '23 period, and enhanced Apple's product diversity, ecosystem and user engagement across platforms.  </p><h2>Intense competition, a product-centric business and concentration of supply chain increase risks despite Apple's solid track record of managing these challenges </h2><p>Apple faces intense competition across each of its product and service offerings. As a product-centric company, it has execution risks from short product life cycles, the need to adapt to shifting consumer preferences, and managing a large and complex supply chain with frequent product upgrades. Execution risks in ramping up production in its global operations at large scale and anticipating the right level of demand, is high. Demand for Apple's premium priced products is susceptible to macroeconomic conditions, and in foreign markets, additionally to changes in foreign exchange rates. Apple's products are primarily manufactured in China, which is also Apple's second largest market by revenues. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company is the sole provider of the company's integrated processors built with the industry-leading manufacturing processes that contribute to Apple's product leadership in products.  </p><p>Apple has largely sidestepped any adverse impact on its businesses from US - China trade tensions. Apple's strong supply chain management over the years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate its world class risk management and resiliency of its operations. However, growing tensions between China and the US, and increasing focus of the US and European nations on controlling semiconductor exports to China to preserve national security advantages which could lead to more export controls, increase risks for Apple's supply chain in China. Apple's primary manufacturing partner, Foxconn, which operates a large facility in China, has faced labor unrest. The COVID-19 pandemic and rising geopolitical tensions have exposed vulnerabilities in global technology supply chains. Apple has been diversifying its manufacturing facilities and assembly operations outside of China but replicating the extensive supply chain outside of China at scale will likely be a multi-year effort and require investments from Apple to directly or indirectly support its outsourcing partners in scaling manufacturing facilities outside of China.  </p><h2>Regulatory scrutiny and legal risks centered on App Store and licensing businesses represent paramount risks </h2><p>Apple's Aaa rating incorporates Moody's view of Apple's world class risk management capabilities, robust financial profile, and diversifying offerings, which should allow the company to preserve or strengthen its financial profile despite the regulatory challenges. Regulatory uncertainties targeting large technology companies that operate in digital commerce markets have materially amplified in recent years. For Apple, these risks are primarily centered on certain parts of its Services segment. Growth in the Services category has substantially contributed to Apple's operating profit growth over the last several years and we expect Apple's share of gross profits from the Services category to continue to grow, increasing its business diversity and reducing earnings volatility. But its App Store business (part of the Services category) faces risks from new laws in the US and Europe aiming to promote competition in digital marketplaces and platforms, heightened scrutiny from antitrust regulators in a number of countries, and private antitrust legal challenges in the US and Europe. In addition, Apple's licensing revenues (also part of Services revenues) that it generates from Google are under legal scrutiny. The US Department of Justice has initiated an antitrust lawsuit against Google alleging that Google's agreements with device manufacturers, wireless carriers and browser developers that require Google's search engines to be preset as a default search engine, are exclusionary and anticompetitive. Under these agreements, Google pays substantial amounts to its distribution partners. Apple does not break out its revenues from App Store and its licensing agreements with Google. We estimate that revenues from these businesses accounted for about half of Apple's Services revenues and an even larger share of gross profit for its Services segment. Given the significance of these revenue streams, regulatory and legal risks will remain Apple's principal risks until there is greater clarity about how legislative changes and regulatory actions could affect its highly profitable revenue streams. It is likely that the fog of uncertainty may not clear over the next several years given the history of antitrust cases.  </p><p>Apple, along with other multinational corporations, could also face higher taxes on revenues generated outside their domestic jurisdictions as part of a global tax reform initiative. But we do not expect higher taxes on foreign revenues to have a meaningful impact on Apple's credit profile given its substantial profitability and cash flow. In September 2020, the European Commission appealed to the court of final appeal in the European Union against a lower court's decision to annul European Commission's claim that Ireland granted state aid to Apple in assessing taxes on earnings from certain local subsidiaries. Apple had $14.1 billion of cash at F3Q '23 that was restricted from general use while the dispute is pending .  </p><p>Regulations governing consumers' personal data and its use by digital platforms including the EU's General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020, reflect heightened regulatory focus on this area. Apple describes data privacy as a fundamental human right. Apple's operating system software require software publishers to obtain permission from users to allow tracking of the users or access the device's advertising identifiers. These changes have upended the digital advertising industry's ability to serve targeted, performance ads and increased tensions between industry participants. The confluence of new regulations with varying standards in different jurisdictions and the lack of clarity in existing regulations about who owns consumers' data in digital businesses create an uncertain business environment for Apple and other digital businesses.  </p><p>Apple's information systems store personally identifiable information about the company's millions of customers and are increasingly used to authorize access to secure networks. Apple's pre-eminent business profile and brand reputation increases the risk of reputational harm or business disruptions from cybersecurity breaches although the company has not experienced any noteworthy lapses in this area.   </p>""",

    """<h2>Revenue and profitability have rebounded rapidly after the pandemic and LVMH is well positioned to continue to outperform its industry </h2><p>LVMH has had strong operating performance over the past couple of years, which has resulted in increased scale and improved profitability. This strong performance has in turn translated into robust credit metrics, which recovered rapidly after the Tiffany acquisition and currently position LVMH strongly at A1. </p><p>The coronavirus pandemic and the related measures taken by governments, such as lockdowns and store closures, resulted in a sharp decline in global luxury goods sales in 2020. However, this decline was followed by a strong recovery in 2021. LVMH reported particularly strong growth rates in most of its segments and reached already in 2021 revenue and operating profit well above their 2019, pre-pandemic, levels. Strong growth continued in 2022 and LVMH posted organic growth of 20% in the nine months ended September 2022. Growth was particularly strong in Europe, which benefited from the return of international travel and increased local consumption, while operating performance was more subdued in Asia, mainly because of the zero-COVID policy implemented in China and the lockdowns that affected various cities during the course of 2022.  </p><p>LVMH's Moody's-adjusted EBITDA margin, which had reached 34.5% in 2021, a 500-basis-point improvement over 2019, remained around that level for the 12 months ended June 2022. This improvement was largely driven by the strong growth of the Fashion and Leather Goods segment, which is also the most profitable segment of the group.  </p><Artifact id="8fdf73d8-6a4f-11ed-9826-8d83154a9f9f"/><p>We expect the company's revenue to grow in the mid- to high-single digits in percentage terms in 2023-24, although there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the growth trajectory because of a difficult macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop following the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the zero-COVID policy applied in China. Asia (excluding Japan) generated 35% of group sales in 2021 and we estimate that China represents more than half of the region's sales. </p><p>We expect the current margin levels to be to a large extent sustainable despite the current inflationary pressures because of the company's ability to pass on higher costs to customers.  As a result, we expect the EBITDA margin to remain around 32%-34% over the next 12-18 months.  </p><h2>Challenging near-term macroeconomic outlook, but demographic trends will continue to support medium-term growth in luxury sales</h2><p>Luxury goods are discretionary products and, therefore, their sales are partly correlated to economic cycles. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates can also affect tourist demand and, therefore, regional performances. However, the industry has diverse segments, such as apparel, beauty products, jewelry and watches, which are subject to different dynamics. In addition, rising demand from emerging markets, most notably from China, mitigated broader market declines in the past; for instance, industry sales fell by only 8% in 2009 (see Exhibit 7). LVMH is present in diverse segments of the luxury goods sector, which has provided stability to the group. For example, LVMH's Wines &amp; Spirits division reported the smallest sales decline during the first half of 2020 when the pandemic started. </p><Artifact id="d8cf9b3c-6b48-11ed-9826-8d83154a9f9f"/><p>The 2023 market outlook is clouded by the difficult geopolitical and macroeconomic context. The relatively high disposable income of luxury goods customers provides some buffer against any temporary pressure, but a more severe global recession could have some impact, especially on the younger generation of customers, who have relatively lower income and now represent a large share of the demand for luxury goods (according to Bain and Altagamma, about 60% of customers were from generations Y and Z in 2021). The zero-COVID policy and the consequent lockdowns in several cities in China also add a degree of uncertainty over one major growth engine of demand for personal luxury goods. Nevertheless, the sector has a track record of rapid rebound after difficult years, as illustrated during the 2008-09 financial crisis and more recently during the pandemic. The largest companies in the sector have also shown an ability to pass on regular price increases without affecting sales volumes. </p><p>Over the medium term, the rising number of wealthy individuals worldwide will continue to fuel the growth of the luxury goods industry, with Chinese consumers being an important growth driver. However, demand from China may gradually slow in the long term as the Chinese market matures.  </p><h2>LVMH's strong brand portfolio is a key credit strength, mitigated by some earnings concentration</h2><p>LVMH's prestigious portfolio of brands is a key pillar of its credit quality. It owns some of the most valuable luxury brands in the world, such as Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Hennessy and Bulgari. In 2021, LVMH added the Tiffany brand to its portfolio, which benefits from global recognition and caters to customers of diverse backgrounds, ranging from higher-income customers to very high-net-worth individuals.  </p><p>Although LVMH does not disclose the performance of each brand, Louis Vuitton's share of the group's consolidated earnings is sizable. Since H2 2020, the stronger performance of the Fashion and Leather Goods segment (which includes the Louis Vuitton brand) than other segments — namely the Perfumes and Cosmetics, and Selective Retailing segments, which have been recovering more slowly from the pandemic — resulted in greater earnings concentration, with this segment contributing 73% of recurring EBIT in the 12 months that ended June 2022.   </p><p>Although the luxury goods industry has some degree of fashion risk, LVMH has a strong track record of building and strengthening its brands. The group has adopted a long-term strategy of balancing earnings growth and exclusivity, which is credit positive. It also owned a large network of 5,582 stores as of 30 June 2022, which enables it to control pricing and marketing. </p><h2>Rapid recovery after the Tiffany acquisition, with credit metrics likely to remain strongly positioned at A1 in 2022-24</h2><p>On 7 January 2021, LVMH completed its acquisition of Tiffany for $16 billion. With this transaction, which is the largest undertaken by the group so far, LVMH acquired the prestigious Tiffany brand and further strengthened its brand portfolio. The all-cash acquisition of Tiffany increased LVMH's leverage in 2020 to 3.9x because the company pre-funded the entire acquisition consideration in 2020. However, the strong 2021 earnings growth and FCF resulted in the company's credit metrics recovering to pre-acquisition levels as of year-end 2021. Credit metrics further improved during 2022 on the back of the group's strong operating performance. We forecast that LVMH's leverage will be slightly below 2x in 2022 and gradually reduce to 1.7x over 2023-24, positioning the group strongly at A1, and that its Moody's-adjusted FFO)/net debt will be around 50% in 2022 and strengthen to around 60% in 2023-24. </p><p>LVMH's Moody's-adjusted gross debt amounted to €50 billion as of June 2022. Our debt calculation includes about €15 billion of IFRS 16 liabilities and €14 billion of put options granted to third parties, which are mostly made of an option granted to <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Diageo-PLC-credit-rating-362200">Diageo PLC </a> (Diageo, A3 stable) for its 34% share in LVMH's subsidiary Moet Hennessy.

While its dividend payout averaged about 46% in 2017-21, the group reduced its dividend in 2020 by about 30%, taking a cautious stance in the context of the pandemic. Given its large cash balance and cash flow generation, LVMH has undertaken a €1.0 billion share buyback program in 2022 and indicated that it could continue to make share buybacks of €1.0 billion-€1.5 billion annually using excess cash.   </p>""",

    "<p>Bayer's liquidity remains strong. As of 30 June 2023, Bayer held €4.5 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and €2.3 billion of current financial assets. In addition, the company has access to a €4.5 billion revolving credit facility. In combination with funds from operations (after litigation payouts) in the range of €8 billion-€9 billion, these sources comfortably cover dividends of around €2.4 billion, capital expenditure of around €3 billion and swings in working capital. </p>",

    "<p>The stable outlook on the rating reflects our expectation that Bayer will be able to return to credit metrics in line with our expectations for the Baa2 rating.  </p>",
    "Liquidity analysis",
    "<p>The ratings could be upgraded if Moody's-adjusted debt/EBITDA falls below 3.0x and RCF/net debt rises sustainably above 20%. For ratings to be upgraded we would also expect a meaningful de-risking of legal risks, foremost with regards to ongoing glyphosate litigation. </p>",
    """<h2>Diversified business portfolio, with substantial scale in healthcare and crop science activities</h2><p>Bayer's business portfolio is well balanced in terms of both business segment and geography. The exposure to the crop science, pharmaceutical and consumer health sectors mitigates the risks specific to each of these business units to some degree, and provides the company with stable revenue and earnings contributions compared with its peers.  </p><p>The company holds leading positions in all of its segments. With the acquisition of Monsanto in 2018, Bayer became a leading company in crop protection and seeds. Its pharmaceutical business holds leading positions in important therapeutic areas such as cardiovascular, women's health, radiology, ophthalmology and haematology. In addition, the company focuses on new drugs in oncology. Successful new drug development is needed to offset the patent cliff with Xarelto and Eylea. Bayer's consumer health segment is also one of the largest in a fragmented market.  </p><p>In October 2022, Bayer closed the <a href="https://www.moodys.com/researchdocumentcontentpage.aspx?docid=PBC_1321751">sale of its Environmental Science Professional </a> (ESP) business to Cinven for $2.6 billion (around €2.6 billion). The transaction has a neutral impact on Bayer's business profile because the ESP business is not an integral part of the core agricultural business. </p><h2>Crop science's will benefit from long term positive growth fundamentals despite current challenges</h2><p>While the July 2023 profit warning was mainly driven by materially weaker than expected performance of the division, we belive that Bayer's credit profile through the cycle will benefit from its leading market position and longer term favorable demand fundamentals such as world population growth. </p><p>During 2022, Bayer experienced a strong momentum in its Crop Science business. Sales grew by 25% versus the previous year driven by a combination of price increases to offset cost inflation and currency tail winds from foreign-exchange gains as a result of the appreciation of the US dollar. Volumes remained broadly flat. The divisions EBITDA margin expanded to 27.3% from 23.2% as price increases outpaced considerable cost inflation of around €1 billion. However, the division also benefitted from a supply/demand imbalance in glyphosate, which resulted in a positive price and volume effect of around €2 billion. This trend reversed in the first half of 2023 where glyphosate sales declined by 61% yoy. This decline was mainly volume based and driven by inventory destocking. As part of the Q2 2023 earnings call, Bayer revised the outlook for the Crop Science business and now expects sales to decline by 5% in 2023 from previously indicated growth of 3%. This assumes volume recovery in the second half of 2023 combined with pricing similar to Q2 2023. </p><p>Sales in the crop science business amounted to around €25 billion in 2022 and positioned Bayer ahead of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/EI-du-Pont-de-Nemours-and-Company-credit-rating-249000">E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company </a> (Corteva, A3 stable), BASF Ag, part of <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/BASF-SE-credit-rating-78520">BASF (SE) </a> (A3 stable) and <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/Syngenta-AG-credit-rating-600055237/summary" title="www.moodys.com">Syngenta AG </a> (Ba1 positive). Bayer's crop science portfolio is broad-based and well balanced across applications and crops, putting the company in a good position to provide a strong integrated offering to farmers by combining specific seeds with the most appropriate agricultural chemicals. </p><Artifact id="e5e1a9ce-3829-11ee-9ec3-991a15f5f403"/><h2>Bayer's capacity to manage leverage will depend on its ability to generate meaningful FCF </h2><p>Bayer's current leverage of 5.0x on an LTM June 2023 basis (Moody's definition) is above our expectation for the Baa2 rating and driven by rising gross debt along with weak EBITDA generation over the last quarters. We believe that Bayer will need to reduce gross debt to maintain a capital structure commensurate with its current rating. Bayer's ability to reduce gross leverage will mainly depend on FCF generation. The company expects FCF (Bayer definition) at break even level in 2023 after revising its expectation down from previously €3 billion. The main driver for the lower expected cash flow in 2023 are lower than expected growth and profitability in Crop Science, lower than expected inventory reduction due to long cycle times and contractual obligations and lower operating cash flow for the Pharma division due to lower gross profit and higher R&amp;D investments. </p><p>Bayer's ability to generate FCF and consequently apply the cash generated to debt reduction will also depend on litigation payouts, mainly related to the glyphosate, PCBs, Dicamba and Essure litigations. </p><p>The most visible litigation relates to its RoundUp product. While Bayer has recently won seven litigation cases in lower courts, further legal proceedings in the US could result in additional significant financial payouts in excess of what the company has to date provided for. Such a scenario could further delay Bayer's leverage reduction trajectory as higher-than-expected settlement payouts will reduce the company's ability to reduce gross debt. </p><p>As of 1 February 2023, Bayer reported 154,000 claims (up from 138,000 as of 1 February 2022) related to the glyphosate matter, of which around 109,000 have been settled or are not eligible for a settlement for various reasons. For 2023, Bayer guides to settlement payouts (for all legal disputes) in the range of €2 billion-€3 billion, of which the company paid out around €1.7 billion during H1 2023. As of December 2022, the company had provisioned for future litigation cost of around €7.4 billion, which was already reduced by €1.2 billion for the settlements paid out during January 2023. Between 2020 and Q2 2023, total cash outflows related to litigations amounted to around €11.1 billion. </p><h2>Pharmaceutical portfolio is well diversified and recent developments to some extent alleviate concerns around patent expiries </h2><p>Bayer's drug portfolio is relatively well diversified, with therapeutic areas focused on cardiovascular, women's health, radiology, retinal diseases and haematology, where it has leading market positions, as well as oncology. Cardiovascular and women's health contribute about half of divisional sales. While patent expiries for Eylea and Xarelto, and growing competition for Eylea, remain challenges for Bayer's pharmaceutical sales, product launches over the last couple of years are gaining traction and the company is demonstrating progress with regard to its pharmaceutical pipeline.  </p><p>Despite a good trajectory of recent product launches and progress on the pharmaceutical pipeline, Bayer's pharmaceutical division continues to face challenges. The introduction of volume-based pricing in China for Adalat, increasing competition for Eylea, mid-single-digit sales decline for Xarelto and inflationary pressures continue to constitute near-term challenges for Bayer's pharmaceutical portfolio. For 2023, the company expects sales to be on par with 2022 for its pharmaceutical division. </p><p>Bayer's top-selling drugs Xarelto and Eylea are facing patent expiries in most markets through 2026. In October 2021, Bayer announced that the European Patent Office approved the extension of the Xarelto patent protection to mid-January 2026 in Europe, extending it by almost two years from April 2024. The compound will lose its patent in the US in 2025 due to pediatric exclusivity. The once-daily patent of Xarelto will face competition from Q1 2027 onwards.    </p><p>In July 2021, finerenone (Kerendia) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Europe, regulatory approval was granted in February 2022 and it experienced a strong launch momentum in 2022. In July 2019, the US FDA approved darolutamide (marketed as Nubeqa), a jointly developed oncology product by Bayer and Orion Corporation, to treat prostate cancer. In March 2020, the European Medical Agency approved the marketing of Nubeqa in Europe. As of September 2022, Nubeqa had received regulatory approval in most important markets globally and has applied for label extensions. Following strong product launches, Bayer estimates the combined peak sales potential of Nubeqa and Kerendia to be around €6 billion.  </p><p>In September 2020, the company closed the acquisition of KaNDy Therapeutics Ltd. to expand its pipeline in women's healthcare. KaNDy's NT-814 compound has now entered phase III trials and could add peak sales of €1 billion if approved; it is likely to be launched in 2025. Also, Bayer seeks to expand on its Cell and Gene Therapy platform, which it expects to generate tangible sales towards the end of the decade. During 2022, the company also launched phase III trials for factor XIa inhibitor asundexian, a next-generation anticoagulant for which Bayer estimates peak sales potential of around €5 billion. Progress with regard to recent product launches and phase III assets reduces the risk of heavily declining sales and EBITDA contributions of Bayer's pharmaceutical business and the risk of sizeable debt-financed M&amp;A to revamp the pharmaceutical pipeline in the next 12-18 months. </p><Artifact id="8c86e82e-3aa6-11ee-8011-691730dad563"/><p>The company has also indicated that it would focus on early-stage active substances, in-licencing and bolt-on acquisitions. The company paid an upfront consideration of €376 million and €1,252 billion for the KaNDy and Vividion acquisitions, respectively, and is likely to pay additional milestone payments, including potential milestone payments of €431 million related to Vividion Therapeutics and around €1.1 billion related to AskBio.  </p><p>In its consumer health business, Bayer targets to continue to grow its sales (standing at €6.1 billion in 2021) in mid-single-digit percentages above the global market growth rate by targeting the fastest-growing and profitable markets in the US, India, China and other Southeast Asian emerging economies through precision marketing. The consumer health business reported EBITDA margins have expanded to 22.5% in 2022 from 20.9% in 2019 taking advantage of the company's top three market positions in most therapeutic areas, while optimising its cost structure.  </p><h2>Restructuring programmes are costly, but result in annual cost savings in excess of €4.1 billion once implemented </h2><p>In 2022, Bayer announced an additional restructuring/efficiency programme. Implementation costs amount to around €2.6 billion, and the company aims to achieve annual run-rate savings of more than €1.5 billion following the completion of the programme in 2024. The new programme comes in addition to the concluded 2018 programme that had an implementation cost of around €4.4 billion for recurring cost savings of around €2.6 billion. While the programmes are costly to implement, at a total of around €7.0 billion, the savings benefits should help mitigate the increase in input costs in the short term and structurally increase margins, once concluded.  </p><Artifact id="6f7c2888-3b38-11ee-8011-691730dad563"/>""",

    "<p>On 24 July 2023, Bayer AG issued a profit warning and revised down its full-year 2023 sales, EBITDA and free cash flow outlook. The company's revised 2023 outlook guides to EBITDA before special items €11.3-€11.8 billion (previous outlook: €12.5-€13.0 billion); and break even free cash flow before dividends (previous outlook: approximately €3.0 billion). The main reason for the revised outlook is Bayer's Crop Science division where the company experienced further price declines and lower volumes due to destocking in the value chain, especially for glyphosate-based products, as well as adverse weather conditions. This translated into credit metrics which are weak for the Baa2 rating category. Moody's-adjusted leverage was 5.0x in the 12 months ended 30 June 2023 and given the revised company outlook, we expect leverage to remain around that level in 2023. The current development is contrary to Bayer's objective of reducing debt levels substantially, as debt has gone up recently. We expect the company could delever to around 4x by the end of 2024 as EBITDA levels recover with the end of the destocking phase and a normalisation of the glyphosate business, and the company generates free cash flow and reduces debt. Higher-than-expected payouts for litigation continue to pose a risk to the evolution of Bayer's credit quality. Bayer's ability to generate free cash flow (FCF) and consequently apply cash generated to debt reduction will also depend on litigation payouts.  </p><p>If there is a change to the competitive position or change in structural demand of the company's crop science products and/or Bayer's credit metrics remain at current levels, we could move to a negative outlook or reevaluate the appropriateness of the Baa2 rating.  </p><p>The Baa2 rating for Bayer is supported by its leading market position in Crop Science and strong positions in cardiovascular, women's health, ophthalmology and radiology as well as non-prescription drugs.
