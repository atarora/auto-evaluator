What is Apple's financial profile and how is it expected to change in the future?,"Apple Inc. has a robust financial profile characterized by strong cash balances, low gross financial leverage, and substantial free cash flow. As of the third quarter of 2023, Apple had $57 billion of cash in excess of total reported debt, compared to $60 billion a year ago (PBC_1379058). The company's credit profile is strongly supported by the enhanced visibility into its capital allocation from management's financial policy goal of transitioning to a net cash neutral position over time. 

Apple's historical pattern of share repurchases since US tax reform and its strong earnings and cash balances support the expectation that the company will transition to a net cash neutral position gradually over the next 4 to 5 years (PBC_1379058). 

In terms of financial indicators, Apple's Debt/EBITDA ratio has been decreasing over the years, from 1.82 in 2020 to 1.07 in 2023. The EBIT/Interest Expense ratio has also shown a positive trend, although it decreased slightly in 2023 compared to 2022. The EBITDA Margin % has been relatively stable, hovering around 34% in recent years (197800).

The stable rating outlook reflects the expectation that Apple will maintain robust liquidity and generate approximately $90 billion in free cash flow in FY '24 (PBC_1379058). However, there are factors that could lead to a downgrade, such as shifts in financial policy, a large acquisition that leads to a sustained and material increase in financial leverage, or a less than robust liquidity position. Changes in business practices under regulatory or legal pressure that substantially weaken long-term earnings growth prospects and cannot be mitigated over time through changes in financial policy or business activities could also lead to a downgrade (PBC_1379058)."
