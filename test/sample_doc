            """<h2>German economy to contract by 0.3% in 2023, followed by a gradual recovery in 2024</h2><p>Germany exited its winter recession as real GDP stagnated quarter-on-quarter in Q2 2023<sup><a href="#endnote2" id="endnoteref2">2 </a> </sup>, falling short of the modest expansion in the euro area of 0.3%. We expect Germany's growth will continue to lag in the second half of the year as well, resulting in a 0.3% GDP contraction for the year of 2023,<sup><a href="#endnote3" id="endnoteref3">3 </a> </sup> before seeing growth of 1.3% in 2024 (see Exhibit 5).  </p><p>We expect the economically important manufacturing sector to face some pains in the near term, as various surveys showed contraction in both current scenario and businesses' prospects. Still relatively high energy prices continue to weigh on energy intensive industries. External demand weakness and tighter monetary conditions are negatively affecting the German industry and the outlook for investment. Having said that, industrial activity is somewhat sustained by order backlogs. Car manufacturers in particular sharply increased their output in May, with the number of units almost back to the pre-pandemic levels observed in the last quarter of 2019. </p><p>Despite rising wages we project only weak private consumption growth in 2023, given that inflation rates remain high. We expect consumer price inflation (as measured by HICP)<sup><a href="#endnote4" id="endnoteref4">4 </a> </sup> to average 6.1% in 2023 (down from 8.7% in 2022) and decrease further to 3.0% in 2024. </p><p>Downside risks to our forecast remain with the onset of winter especially regarding potential gas shortages. According to the OECD, German gas consumption will have to decrease by around 20% to prevent shortages or significantly higher gas prices if temperatures drop below the winter average, despite currently abundant gas reserves and the construction of new LNG terminals. </p><p>The labor market remains very tight in Germany, with an unemployment rate of 3% at the end of the second quarter in 2023. Demand for skilled labor remains high, with high vacancy numbers in the economy. The demographic issues faced by the country exacerbates the issue as there is no availability of skilled labor to fill the roles. We expect the unemployment rate for 2023 to average around 3.2%, before dipping to 3.1% in 2024. </p><Artifact id="a08239d8-3050-11ee-a53a-5944116e8b40"/><h2>Energy support measures' costs will determine 2023 fiscal deficit size, gradual reduction from 2024 on</h2><p>After Germany's fiscal deficit eased to 2.7% of GDP in 2022 on the back of higher revenues outweighing fiscal support measures, we expect a slight decline in the deficit to 2.6% of GDP in 2023 as government support measures continue to add to spending, and the weaker economic performance will limit revenue growth. In line with the experience following the global financial crisis, we expect a return to gradual fiscal consolidation from 2024, mainly driven by reduced crisis support spending. The government presented its draft 2024 federal budget and 2025-27 financial plans in July, re-adhering to the constitutional debt brake from next year onwards<sup><a href="#endnote5" id="endnoteref5">5 </a> </sup>. At the same time, the changed energy supply situation and geopolitical environment in Europe will lead to structurally higher spending in areas like defence and energy transformation, largely funded through off-budget special funds. </p><p>Our forecast for 2023 is lower compared to government plans of a 4.3% deficit according to the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/system/files/2023-04/German_SP_2023_en.pdf">German Stability Programme </a>, which includes costly estimations for the gas and electricity price brakes. Lower gas and electricity prices than those assumed in the Stability Programme will lead to lower spending from the off-budget Economic Stabilisation Fund (ESF), which has €200 billion (or 5.2% of 2022 GDP) in spending earmarked for energy support measures (including the above mentioned energy price brakes) over 2022-24. As of June 2023, ESF borrowing stood at €59.9 billion<sup><a href="#endnote6" id="endnoteref6">6 </a> </sup>. </p><p>The announced rise in defence expenditure by the government, is only slowly gaining momentum due to long lead times for the purchase of military equipment, as well as bureaucratic hurdles. Borrowing of the €100 billion (or 2-6% of 2022 GDP) off-budget Armed Forces Special Fund (AFSF) stood at a mere €1.3 billion as of May 2023.  </p><p>For the federal government budget, revenues were up (+3.3%) despite tax relief measures and expenditures increased moderately (+0.6%) as of June 2023, with the financial balance standing at minus €47.8 billion. The Länder are currently in deficit – €9.8 billion as of May 2023 – as result of tax relief measures, while social security funds are broadly balanced.  </p><p>After falling to 66.1% of GDP in 2022 (down almost three percentage points compared to a year prior), we estimate that Germany's debt burden will remain stable this year, before resuming a gradual decline – supported by relatively strong nominal GDP growth – from 2024 onwards.  </p><Artifact id="5112af1e-3130-11ee-a53a-5944116e8b40"/><h2>Energy transition and spending pressures are leading to increased strains in the government coalition</h2><p>Increasing strains on government cohesion are reflected in the back and forth, particularly between the Greens and the Free Democrats (FDP), on a recent piece of climate legislation (<em>Gebäudeenergiegesetz </em>). Spending pressures in order to re-adhere to the debt-brake limits are adding to tensions, as reflected in a recent row between the Minister of Finance (FDP) and the Minister of Family Affairs (Greens) regarding the planned cut-down of parental leave benefits. However, none of the three government coalition parties (Social Democratic Party [SPD], Greens and FDP) has an incentive to trigger early elections given their standing in current polls. </p><p>The government also shifted its focus on policies aimed at supporting economic growth. The Ministry of Finance floated a plan for a law to strengthen growth opportunities, investments and innovation (<em>Wachstumschancengesetz </em>) mainly through tax reforms and the introduction of an investment premium, with overall tax reliefs amounting as high as € 5-6 billion (or 0.1% of GDP) yearly starting from 2025. The Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action on the other hand put forward a proposal for the introduction of a subsidised electricity price (<em>Industriestrompreis </em>) for energy-intensive companies of €0.06 per kilowatt hour (kWh) until 2030, which is estimated to cost €25-30 billion over the said period.<sup><a href="#endnote7" id="endnoteref7">7 </a> </sup> We anticipate that the debate around the funding of these policy proposals will continue to test the cohesion among the coalition partners. </p><p>Opposition parties are benefiting from the tensions in the government coalition as recent opinion polls show that all three government coalition parties are losing voter support (SPD: 18%, Greens: 14% and FDP: 7%), with the centre-right party CDU/CSU leading polls (26%), followed by the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD, 21%). However, support for the CDU/CSU has been on a declining trend over the past months, while support for the AfD has been rising against the background of public debate about irregular migration, inflation and high energy prices as well as contentious climate legislation. While we continue to expect that the far right party will not play a role at the federal level in the foreseeable future, we note that CDU party head Friedrich Merz sparked a debate within his party about the possibility to engage with the AfD at the local level.      </p><pagebreak layout="portrait_flow"> </pagebreak>""",

This reflects the country's competitive economy and high productivity levels, which are not adequately reflected in the scorecard at the initial level. Moreover, the "aa3" economic strength score incorporates Germany's large economic size and high per-capita incomes. However, it also reflects Germany's exposure to the risk of economic scarring as the economic importance of industries and sectors most vulnerable to high energy prices and structural change elevates risks. </p><p>Our assessment takes into account Germany's low trend growth of only 0.9% per year on average during 2018 and 2027, which is much lower than the median of 1.8% for Aaa-rated peers. Unfavourable demographics are already reflected in a tight labour market with shortages of skilled labour across many sectors. Ageing will lower Germany's potential growth further from a projected 0.8-0.9% in 2023-2026, to only 0.7% over the late 2020s and early 2030s according to the European Commission's Ageing Report, which is lower than for most Aaa- and Aa1-rated peers. In addition, Germany's manufacturing industry, in particular the sizeable automotive sector, faces transformational challenges from carbon transition and disruptions caused by new technologies and emerging competitors.  </p><p>Our score for <b>institutions and governance strength </b>is "aa1", based on the high quality of legislative and executive institutions, a strong civil society and high quality of the judiciary, as well as strong fiscal and macroeconomic policy effectiveness. German institutions are robust and transparent, and the country has a strong track record of fiscal policy. German governments have demonstrated their ability to reverse debt trends in the past: in the context of German reunification, the low-growth environment of the early 2000s, and during the global financial crisis and euro area debt crisis.  </p><p>Historically low and stable inflation expectations that underpinned the monetary-policy credibility of the European Central Bank (ECB) are now being tested by high inflation levels. Rising interest rates and downside risks to the real economy pose risks to financial stability, most notably the potential underestimation of risks by market participants and vulnerabilities to negative developments in the German real estate market, particularly with respect to the commercial real estate sector. </p><p>The energy crisis following Russia's invasion of Ukraine has highlighted Germany's vulnerabilities and overreliance on Russian energy supplies, and led to a re-orientation of energy and defence policies. Like during the coronavirus pandemic, the German government has acted decisively through a range of measures such as the construction of new import infrastructure for liquified natural gas (LNG) and new legislation to accelerate the build-up of renewable energy sources, which demonstrate robust levels of institutional strength and an effective capacity to mitigate shocks. </p><p>Germany's <b>fiscal strength </b>score is "aa1". This reflects the sovereign's strong public finances and sound fiscal framework, with fiscal rules in place such as the constitutional debt brake. The German government has repeatedly posted fiscal surpluses over the period from 2012 to 2019, which compares favorably with most Aaa-rated peers. </p><p>After large deficits in 2020-21 due to the pandemic-induced recession and related fiscal measures, Germany's fiscal deficit eased to 2.7% of GDP in 2022 largely due to an increase in revenue, and the public debt ratio decreased to 66.1% of GDP from 69.0% in 2021. The size of fiscal deficits in 2023-24 is largely dependent on energy support measures, which hinge on the development of gas and electricity prices, but we project a gradual fiscal consolidation and reduction in the debt burden from 2024. </p><p>Because we classify Germany as reserve currency country<sup><a href="#endnote1" id="endnoteref1">1 </a> </sup>, we focus our assessment of its fiscal strength mainly on debt affordability. The ECB's interest rate hikes have led to higher borrowing costs for Germany, with interest payments likely reaching 1.3% of GDP by 2025 up from 0.7% in 2022, a faster  increase than for peers given Germany's shorter average term to maturity. </p><p>Germany faces sizeable challenges in the future. Absent further reform in areas like public pensions, health and social care, but also in the economy (the labour market, cuts in red tape and acceleration in planning and implementation processes), the total cost of ageing will rise to 27% of GDP by 2070, from around 23% in 2019, which is above the <a href="https://www.moodys.com/credit-ratings/European-Union-credit-rating-600049532/summary">EU </a> (Aaa stable) average. These costs will widen fiscal deficits and increase general government debt to well above 80% of GDP. </p><p>We assess the <b>susceptibility to event risk </b>for Germany at "baa", driven by political and banking sector event risks.  </p><p>We assess Germany's <em>susceptibility to political risk </em> as "baa", driven by geopolitical factors. The government's announcements in 2022 to ramp up defence spending reflects the changed geopolitical situation since February 2022. Germany's NATO membership is ultimately a guarantor of national security, but the country also faces contagion risks as it is bound by NATO's Article 5 collective defense clause, which treats an attack on any NATO member as an attack on all treaty signatories. The EU's Mutual Defence Clause (Article 42.7 of the Lisbon Treaty) would also apply if the conflict involved an EU country. While not our base case because of the deterrent effect of these clauses, the probability of such risks materializing have increased in light of the ongoing military conflict. </p><p>Regarding domestic political risk, like other highly developed democracies, Germany will face challenges in reaching a political consensus on economic and social security reforms that would adequately address the country's significant demographic challenges.  </p><p>Our assessment of <em>banking sector related event risk  </em>is "baa", reflecting moderate risks stemming from the potential crystallisation of contingent liabilities from the banking system on the government's balance sheet. </p><p>We assess <em>government liquidity risk  </em>and <em>external vulnerability risk  </em>as "aaa", supported by Germany's very strong capital market access and safe haven status, large current account surpluses, and a strongly positive net asset international investment position. </p>""",
